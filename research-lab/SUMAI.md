# SumAI — The Divergent Engine of SomeAI

## The Duality

SomeAI is not one company. It is two engines running in opposite directions, feeding each other.

**SumAI** (Sigma AI) is the divergent engine — the research lab. It does not care about individual client problems. It maintains the frontier, widens research exposure, and maintains Charlotte. "I **SUM** AI in my research lab." SumAI is where ideas go to multiply. Every discipline, every modality, every sense — studied individually, then combined systematically until the combinations themselves reveal new disciplines.

**SomeAI** is the convergent engine — the client-facing business. It consolidates research into tangible, deployable solutions. "I give **Some** AI to the public." SomeAI takes what SumAI discovers and deploys it into agriculture, industrial service, sports, medicine, ocean conservation — wherever Charlotte can observe reality and make it legible.

Together they create a healthy ebb and flow: SumAI pushes the frontier outward, SomeAI pulls deployable solutions inward. Innovation pumped constantly into the industries we touch. Neither engine works without the other. Research without deployment is academic. Deployment without research is stagnation.

## The OASIS

The first SumAI research lab is called **OASIS**.

The name connects to the Serengeti vision — a place where researchers gather at the frontier, where the most difficult problems find the space and time they need. The OASIS is not a campus. It is an environment designed from the ground up to facilitate the multimodal deployment of AI solutions by studying the senses individually and slowly working them together.

## The Five Senses + Brain

SomeAI was founded to build a research lab that studies the individual human senses — how they work, how they can be mimicked, how they can be augmented by AI, and what happens when you combine them. This is the organizing principle of all SumAI research.

### The Six Pillars

| Pillar | Domain | Real-World Applications |
|--------|--------|------------------------|
| **Sight** | Computer vision, medical imaging, spatial computing | Medical imaging, sports video analysis, satellite/drone imagery, autonomous navigation |
| **Touch** | Haptics, robotics, sensory interfaces, biomechanics | Surgical robotics, agricultural soil/texture sensing, prosthetics, VR/AR haptics |
| **Taste** | Molecular gastronomy, chemical analysis, atmospheric design | Culinary science, food safety, pharmaceutical taste-masking, environmental monitoring |
| **Sound** | Acoustics, signal processing, audio AI, communication | Marine biology (whale songs, reef health), music/speech AI, industrial vibration analysis, sonar |
| **Smell** | Olfactory sensing, chemical detection, environmental monitoring | Plant/animal health diagnostics, air quality, explosive/drug detection, disease screening |
| **Brain** | Charlotte OS, knowledge integration, multimodal fusion | The center — where all sensory research converges into Charlotte's unified substrate |

### Why Senses?

Every domain SomeAI touches is ultimately a sensing problem. A farm is sight (crop imaging) + smell (plant health) + touch (soil quality). A surgical suite is sight (imaging) + touch (haptics) + sound (monitoring). An ocean reef is sound (sonar) + sight (underwater cameras) + smell (water chemistry). A Michelin-star kitchen is taste + smell + touch + sight + sound — completely atmospheric.

The senses are the universal interface between reality and observation. Charlotte is the infrastructure for observable reality. SumAI studies the senses. The connection is structural, not metaphorical.

## The Hexagonal Layout

The OASIS is designed using **Central Place Theory** — hexagonal tessellation that maximizes accessibility, minimizes travel distance, and creates natural hierarchies of specialization.

```
                        TOUCH
                    ┌───────────┐
                   /  Touch III  \
           TASTE  / ┌─────────┐  \ SMELL
                 /  │Touch II │  \
                / ┌─┤         ├─┐ \
               /  │ │ Touch I │ │  \
              /   │ ├─────────┤ │   \
         Taste III│ │         │ │Smell III
          ┌───────┤ │  BRAIN  │ ├───────┐
         Taste II │ │         │ │Smell II
              \   │ ├─────────┤ │   /
               \  │ │ Sight I │ │  /
                \ └─┤         ├─┘ /
                 \  │Sight II │  /
           SOUND  \ └─────────┘  / SIGHT
                   \ Sight III  /
                    └───────────┘
                        SOUND
```

### The Progression System

Every researcher enters the OASIS at **Level I** of their primary sense. A computer vision researcher starts at Sight I. A haptics engineer starts at Touch I. A neurosurgeon starts at Brain.

**Levels I-V** represent increasing depth within a single sense:
- **Level I:** Fundamentals — sensing, signal acquisition, basic AI models
- **Level II:** Advanced — real-time processing, domain-specific applications
- **Level III:** Expert — novel research, pushing the frontier of that sense
- **Level IV:** Pioneer — contributions that define the field
- **Level V:** Architect — designing the infrastructure that future researchers build on

### Cross-Sensory Progression

As researchers deepen in their primary sense, they gain clearance to adjacent senses in the hexagonal layout. The boundaries between hex sections are where cross-sensory research happens:

**Two-sense combinations (first unlock):**
- Sight + Touch → Surgical robotics, haptic feedback from visual input
- Sight + Sound → Audio-visual scene understanding, lip reading
- Touch + Taste → Texture-flavor correlation, food science
- Sound + Smell → Environmental monitoring (gas leak detection via acoustic + chemical)
- Smell + Taste → Molecular gastronomy, pharmaceutical formulation
- ...all 10 pairwise combinations

**Three-sense combinations (deeper layer):**
- Sight + Touch + Sound → Autonomous manipulation with sensory feedback
- Taste + Smell + Touch → Full culinary science stack (the Enigma connection)
- ...all 10 triple combinations

**Four-sense combinations (sub-layers):**
- The 5 quadruple combinations
- Each requiring mastery of at least 3 individual senses

**Five-sense integration (the innermost ring around Brain):**
- The most difficult implementations
- Years of combined research to unlock
- Full multimodal AI — Charlotte observing reality through all channels simultaneously

### The 8-Year Rotation

A hypothetical full rotation through the OASIS:

| Years | Focus | Outcome |
|-------|-------|---------|
| 1-2 | Primary sense Level I-II | Foundational mastery |
| 2-3 | Primary sense Level III + first cross-sensory | Expert + breadth |
| 3-5 | Two-sense combinations, primary to Level IV | Novel cross-modal research |
| 5-7 | Three-sense combinations, mentoring new Level I | Pioneer status |
| 7-8 | Four/five-sense integration or deep specialization (Level V) | Architect or full multimodal |

Researchers can also choose to **specialize** — staying in Smell I through Smell V without branching, becoming the world's deepest expert in olfactory AI. Both paths are valued. The hexagonal layout supports both breadth and depth naturally.

## Current Real-World Positioning

SumAI's research pillars map to SomeAI's active deployment verticals:

| SomeAI Vertical | Primary Senses | Current State |
|-----------------|---------------|---------------|
| **Agriculture Tech** | Sight + Smell + Touch | Sounder deployed, farm-by-farm digital twin strategy |
| **Sports Science** | Sight + Touch + Sound | Charlotte for athlete tracking, performance prediction |
| **Ocean Science** | Sound + Sight + Smell | Swarm intelligence for reef restoration, microdrone ecosystem cleanup |
| **Biomimicry** | All senses | Animal science, inter-species relationship modeling — the umbrella |
| **Medicine** | Sight + Touch + Brain | Medical imaging, neuroscience, psychiatry, surgical robotics |

Each deployment vertical is a **convergent application** of research that started as **divergent exploration** in the OASIS. The chef at Enigma in Barcelona got excited about taste bud research because SumAI's Taste pillar is adjacent to Touch — and the sensory details that go into a 3-Michelin-star dining experience are completely atmospheric. Every plate is a multimodal signal: taste + smell + touch (texture) + sight (plating) + sound (ambience). That is a five-sense problem. That is what the OASIS is built to study.

         └──────────── BRAIN ──────────────────┘
                   (shared substrate)
```

SumAI discovers. SomeAI deploys. Deployments generate real-world signals that feed back into research. Charlotte is the substrate that both engines run on. The Brain pillar maintains Charlotte itself — the infrastructure for observable reality that makes all of this possible.

## The Team Structure

### Imagineers (Pillar Leads)
Active scientists, engineers, and post-graduates in their late 20s to early 30s. Each leads research in one of the six pillars. They are the builders — the people doing the frontier work.

### Mentors
Industry veterans in their 40s to 80s, paired 1-to-many with Imagineers. Neuro and heart surgeons, experimental chefs, professors at Northwestern and Stanford and Yale. They keep the Imagineers on the frontier by providing decades of domain expertise, pattern recognition, and access to problems worth solving.

### Advisory Board
Industry leaders who advise on the strategic shaping of SomeAI's research direction. Not necessarily mentoring individuals, but steering the research agenda. They are looking to mentor the next wave of innovators in a pride/tribe environment.

### The Pride Model
The team operates as a pride — the Serengeti metaphor made literal. Imagineers are the hunters. Mentors are the experienced pride members who teach hunting patterns. Advisors are the territorial anchors who define where the pride operates. Everyone benefits from the collective knowledge density.

## Why This Matters

The research lab is not an abstraction. It is the engine that ensures SomeAI never becomes just another consulting firm deploying yesterday's technology. Every client deployment — ISG, Sounder, All State, Top Tier — benefits from ongoing research that widens the frontier. And every frontier discovery eventually becomes a deployable solution.

The question is never "what can Charlotte do?" The question is "what can Charlotte observe?" And the answer, as the OASIS expands, is: everything a human can sense, and eventually, everything a human cannot.
