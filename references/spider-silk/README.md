# Spider Silk

Biomaterials research segment. Spider silk biology, humane spider husbandry, silk harvesting, social spider collective behavior, web architecture as network science, synthetic silk engineering, and swarm intelligence applications.

## Why Spider Silk

Spider dragline silk has a tensile strength of ~1.3 GPa at 1/6 the density of steel, 30-40% extensibility, and toughness exceeding Kevlar. It is spun at room temperature in water from a protein feedstock. No industrial process comes close to replicating this combination of properties. The material is biocompatible, biodegradable, and self-assembling. Understanding it — and eventually producing it — is one of the great open problems in materials science.

## Why Spiders (Not Just Silk)

The silk is the product. The spider is the factory. But the spider is also a research subject in its own right:

- **Social spiders** (Anelosimus, Stegodyphus) exhibit cooperative web construction, collective prey capture, and division of labor — genuine swarm intelligence in arachnids
- **Web architecture** is an emergent optimization process — no blueprint, no central plan, just local rules producing geometrically precise structures. The web is a graph. The spider is a graph builder. This is Charlotte's domain.
- **Vibrational signaling** through silk threads is a distributed communication network — the web functions as an extended nervous system

## Scope

This is one of six business research segments — the **Biomaterials** vertical.

| Segment | Domain | Lead |
|---|---|---|
| Agriculture | Livestock, breeding, land management | Delegated |
| Sports Science | Human performance, training, biomechanics | Delegated |
| Ocean Science | Scuba diving research, marine biology | Founder-led |
| **Biomaterials** | **Spider silk, biomimetic materials** | **Research arm** |

## Reference Hub

The [`index.html`](index.html) reference hub maps the knowledge space across spider silk biology, husbandry, collective behavior, web architecture, synthetic silk, applications, and swarm robotics. Same pattern as the neuroscience, biomimicry, and ocean science hubs.

## Farm Concept

Humane spider management for research-grade silk extraction:

- Social species colonies (Anelosimus eximius, Stegodyphus dumicola) as primary candidates
- Controlled environment: humidity, temperature, light cycle, prey supply, vibration isolation
- Non-lethal forced silking for individual species research
- Colony-scale observation for swarm intelligence studies
- Ethical framework: enrichment, natural behavior expression, minimal stress protocols

The farm is a future build. This reference hub is the prerequisite knowledge map.
