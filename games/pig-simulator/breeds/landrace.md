**The Long Pig. The Mother. The Workhorse Behind the Curtain.**

## Real-World Profile

| Attribute | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| **Registry** | NSR (National Swine Registry) |
| **Origin** | Denmark (American Landrace refined in the U.S.) |
| **Color** | White with large, drooping ears |
| **Primary Use** | Maternal line — the #1 dam breed worldwide |
| **Key Strengths** | Litter size, milk production, docility, longevity |
| **Industry Role** | Foundation of F1 crossbred females (Landrace × Yorkshire = the commercial sow) |

### Real EPD Ranges (NSR data)
- **Backfat:** -0.03 to +0.07 in (moderate)
- **Loin Muscle Area:** +0.05 to +0.30 sq in (moderate)
- **Days to 250:** -3.0 to +4.0 days (moderate growth)
- **Number Born Alive:** +0.8 to +2.5 piglets (highest in any breed)

### Why Landrace Matter
If Yorkshire is the queen of maternal breeds, Landrace is the empress. The commercial pork industry runs on Landrace × Yorkshire F1 females — they have the largest litters, the most milk, and the longest productive lives of any cross. Landrace genetics are in virtually every commercial sow in the Western world. They're not glamorous. They're essential.

## Game Profile

### Difficulty: Intermediate

Landrace aren't hard to handle — they're docile and cooperative. The difficulty comes from showing them well. They're long, floppy-eared, and don't have the visual punch of a Hampshire or Duroc. Making a Landrace look good in the ring requires precise positioning and constant attention to ear/head presentation.

### Game Stats (Base)
| Stat | Value | Range |
|------|-------|-------|
| Muscle | 4/10 | Below average — not a muscle breed |
| Leanness | 5/10 | Moderate — carries functional condition |
| Growth Rate | 6/10 | Moderate, steady gains |
| Fertility | 10/10 | The best. Nothing else is close. |
| Soundness | 5/10 | Adequate but can be loose-structured |
| Temperament | 9/10 | Extremely docile. Almost too relaxed. |

### Ring Behavior AI
- **Walking:** Slow, lumbering gait. The long body sways slightly. Not ugly, but not graceful.
- **Stopping:** Stops easily. Almost too easily — can be sluggish to restart.
- **Turning:** Wide turns due to body length. Tight turns look awkward.
- **Under pressure:** Barely reacts. Needs more stick pressure than any other breed. Patient but unresponsive.
- **Fatigue:** Low energy overall. Needs encouragement to keep moving in long classes.
- **Quirk:** The ears. Landrace ears droop over the face, partially covering the eyes. The pig tilts its head to see past them. This creates a distinctive head-tilt movement that judges either love or tolerate.

### Personality
Landrace are the gentle giants. They don't fight. They don't spook. They don't do much of anything without encouragement. Showing a Landrace is like driving a school bus — it goes where you point it, eventually, and it's not exciting, but it gets there. The skill is in making the journey look intentional.

### Why Choose Landrace
- You're building a maternal program (10/10 fertility is game-changing)
- You want the most cooperative pig in the game (9/10 temperament)
- You want Landrace × Yorkshire F1 females (the commercial gold standard)
- You find the floppy ears charming (some people do)

### Why Not Landrace
- You want to win purebred show classes (Landrace struggle against flashier breeds)
- You want an exciting ring experience (Landrace are calm to the point of boring)
- You want muscle and eye appeal (look elsewhere)

## Sprite Notes

### Silhouette
- **Very long body** — longest breed in the game by significant margin
- **Large, drooping ears** — the defining feature. Ears hang down past the snout.
- **Flat topline** that extends the full length of the body
- **White coloring** — similar to Yorkshire but distinguished by ear type and body length
- **Longer snout** than Yorkshire

### Proportions (32×32 base)
- Body length: ~22px (longest breed — this is the key visual)
- Body depth: ~9px (not deep, just long)
- Leg height: ~7px
- Ear droop: ears extend 3-4px below jawline (major visual differentiator from Yorkshire)
- Snout: 1px longer than Yorkshire

### Animation Notes
- Walk cycle should feel **swaying and deliberate**. The long body creates a visible wave motion.
- Ears bounce and sway with movement — secondary animation priority.
- Head tilts to one side periodically (seeing past the ears) — breed-specific idle animation.
- Breathing: visible along the full length of the body. Long, slow breaths.
- When spooked: barely reacts. Ears perk slightly (as much as droopy ears can), body stiffens, then relaxes. Understated.
- The ear droop must read at small scale — this is the only visual difference from Yorkshire.

## Breeding Value

### As Dam
- **The maternal queen.** 10/10 fertility. Largest litters, most milk, longest productive life.
- Landrace × Yorkshire F1 females are the game's best commercial dams
- Landrace × Hampshire dams add leanness to the maternal side
- Every serious breeding program should have Landrace genetics in the dam line

### As Sire
- Rarely used as terminal sire. Muscle and eye appeal don't justify it.
- Landrace sire × other breeds adds maternal capacity to the next generation
- Useful for building a maternal line, not for producing show-ring market hogs

### Genetic Tendencies
- Fertility is *highly* heritable in Landrace — prolific sows produce prolific daughters
- Body length breeds true — Landrace crosses are always longer than the other parent breed
- Risk: structural looseness. Landrace can be loose in the front end and weak in the pasterns.
- Selection for soundness is critical — don't sacrifice feet and legs for litter size
