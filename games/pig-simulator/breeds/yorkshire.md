## Real-World Profile

| Attribute | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| **Registry** | NSR (National Swine Registry) |
| **Origin** | Yorkshire, England |
| **Color** | White with erect ears |
| **Primary Use** | Maternal line; seedstock and commercial |
| **Key Strengths** | Litter size, milk production, longevity, structural soundness |
| **Registrations** | Most registered breed in the U.S. |

### Real EPD Ranges (NSR data)
- **Backfat:** -0.05 to +0.08 in (breed average moderate)
- **Loin Muscle Area:** +0.10 to +0.40 sq in
- **Days to 250:** -5.0 to +3.0 days
- **Number Born Alive:** +0.5 to +2.0 piglets

### Why Yorkshires Matter
Yorkshire is the most commonly registered purebred in America. They're the backbone of the commercial industry — most terminal cross programs use Yorkshire or Yorkshire × Landrace females as the maternal line. In the show ring, they compete primarily in purebred breeding classes and as the maternal component of crossbred market hogs.

## Game Profile

### Difficulty: Beginner

Yorkshire is the recommended first breed. Forgiving temperament, predictable movement, and strong maternal traits make it the best platform for learning.

### Game Stats (Base)
| Stat | Value | Range |
|------|-------|-------|
| Muscle | 5/10 | Moderate — not flashy, but correct |
| Leanness | 6/10 | Good lean growth potential |
| Growth Rate | 7/10 | Solid, consistent gains |
| Fertility | 9/10 | Highest litter sizes of any breed |
| Soundness | 7/10 | Structurally correct; good feet and legs |
| Temperament | 8/10 | Calm and cooperative |

### Ring Behavior AI
- **Walking:** Steady, rhythmic gait. Holds line well. Doesn't fight the stick.
- **Stopping:** Plants feet cleanly. Holds brace position reliably.
- **Turning:** Smooth, predictable turns. Follows stick pressure consistently.
- **Under pressure:** Rarely spooks. If startled, recovers quickly. May slow down rather than bolt.
- **Fatigue:** Moderate endurance. Slows noticeably in long classes.
- **Quirk:** Occasionally roots the sawdust if left standing too long. Keep them moving.

### Personality
Yorkshires are the reliable partners. They won't wow the judge with athleticism, but they won't embarrass you either. A well-conditioned Yorkshire presented smoothly can beat flashier breeds that break composure. They reward consistency.

### Why Choose Yorkshire
- You're new to showing
- You want to build a maternal program (best fertility in the game)
- You want a pig that cooperates while you learn the mechanics
- Grandpa Earl showed Yorkshires — there's story significance here

### Why Not Yorkshire
- You want to win on muscle expression (Duroc/Hampshire are better)
- You want the most eye-catching pig in the ring (Yorkshire is plain white)
- You're ready for a challenge

## Sprite Notes

### Silhouette
- **Long body**, slightly longer proportional to height than Duroc or Hampshire
- **Erect ears** — key distinguishing feature, always visible in profile
- **Straight topline** with slight arch over the loin
- **Clean underline** — visible teat line on females (matters for breeding classes)
- **White coloring** — no markings. Pure white with pink skin visible on nose/ears

### Proportions (32×32 base)
- Body length: ~20px (longest breed proportionally)
- Leg height: ~8px
- Ear height above head: 2-3px (erect, forward-pointing)
- Tail: short curl, 2px

### Animation Notes
- Walk cycle should feel **steady and level**. Minimal vertical bounce.
- The topline stays nearly flat during movement — this is the Yorkshire look.
- Ear position is key — erect ears should be visible in all side-view frames.
- Breathing animation: sides expand slightly. Steady rhythm.
- When spooked: ears go back first, then body stiffens. Recovers in 2-3 frames.

## Breeding Value

### As Dam
- **Best maternal breed in the game.** 9/10 fertility means large litters.
- Yorkshire × Duroc cross produces excellent market hogs (muscle from Duroc, structure from Yorkshire)
- Yorkshire × Hampshire cross produces balanced market hogs with eye appeal

### As Sire
- Less commonly used as terminal sire (muscle not elite enough)
- Yorkshire × Yorkshire matings are the purebred play — chasing Grand Champion Purebred Yorkshire
- Good for backcrossing into programs that need more maternal capacity

### Genetic Tendencies
- Consistent. Low variance on most traits. What you expect is what you get.
- Fertility breeds true — high-NBA sows tend to produce high-NBA daughters
- Risk: can drift toward too long and too lean without enough muscle selection pressure
