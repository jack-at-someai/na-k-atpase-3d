# Duroc

**The Red Pig. The Athlete. The Muscle Machine.**

## Real-World Profile

| Attribute | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| **Registry** | NSR (National Swine Registry) |
| **Origin** | Northeastern United States |
| **Color** | Red (ranges from light gold to dark mahogany) |
| **Primary Use** | Terminal sire line; muscle and growth |
| **Key Strengths** | Growth rate, muscle expression, feed efficiency, meat quality |
| **Industry Role** | Most common terminal sire breed in the U.S. commercial industry |

### Real EPD Ranges (NSR data)
- **Backfat:** -0.08 to +0.04 in (leaner than average)
- **Loin Muscle Area:** +0.20 to +0.60 sq in (highest of any breed)
- **Days to 250:** -8.0 to +1.0 days (fastest growing)
- **Number Born Alive:** +0.2 to +1.0 piglets (moderate fertility)

### Why Durocs Matter
Durocs are the engine of the American pork industry. When a commercial producer picks a boar to sire market hogs, it's usually a Duroc or Duroc-influenced sire. They grow fast, convert feed efficiently, and put on muscle. In the show ring, Durocs are the flashiest purebred — big-topped, heavy-muscled, deep cherry-red color that catches the eye.

## Game Profile

### Difficulty: Intermediate

Durocs are responsive and athletic, which makes them rewarding when you drive them well — and punishing when you don't. They react faster than Yorkshires to stick pressure, which means your mistakes show immediately.

### Game Stats (Base)
| Stat | Value | Range |
|------|-------|-------|
| Muscle | 8/10 | Elite — best purebred muscle expression |
| Leanness | 7/10 | Lean and tight; good backfat |
| Growth Rate | 9/10 | Fastest growing breed |
| Fertility | 5/10 | Moderate litters |
| Soundness | 6/10 | Generally sound but can be coarse-boned |
| Temperament | 5/10 | Athletic; reactive; needs confident handling |

### Ring Behavior AI
- **Walking:** Quick, forward-moving gait. Wants to go. Can get ahead of the handler if not controlled.
- **Stopping:** Reluctant to stop. Needs firm pressure. Once braced, holds well.
- **Turning:** Sharp, athletic turns. Can overcorrect — handler needs light touch.
- **Under pressure:** Responds immediately to stick contact. Too much pressure and it bolts. Too little and it ignores you.
- **Fatigue:** High endurance. Stays active throughout long classes. Almost too much energy.
- **Quirk:** "Hot" Durocs will speed up when other pigs are moving nearby. Herd instinct creates urgency. Stay calm.

### Personality
Durocs are the racehorses of the pig world. They want to move. They have opinions about where they're going. A skilled handler looks like a dancer with a Duroc — everything flows, the pig moves with purpose, and the muscle rolls under the skin. An unskilled handler looks like they're being dragged.

### Why Choose Duroc
- You want the best muscle expression in the game
- You're comfortable with faster-paced ring dynamics
- You want a terminal sire for your breeding program
- You want the pig that makes the crowd say "ooh"

### Why Not Duroc
- You're still learning basic driving (start with Yorkshire)
- You want high litter sizes (Duroc fertility is moderate)
- You need a forgiving training partner

## Sprite Notes

### Silhouette
- **Thick, muscular body** — wider through the shoulder and ham than Yorkshire
- **Drooping ears** — key distinguishing feature. Ears hang forward, covering the eyes slightly.
- **Heavy topline** — pronounced muscle over the loin and through the back
- **Deep-sided** — more body depth than Yorkshire
- **Red coloring** — varies from gold-red to dark mahogany. Single solid color, no markings.

### Proportions (32×32 base)
- Body length: ~18px (shorter than Yorkshire, more compact)
- Body depth: ~12px (deepest breed)
- Leg height: ~7px (shorter relative to body — stocky look)
- Ear position: drooping forward, 1-2px below horizontal
- Muscle bulge: visible on ham (rear 4px should show roundness)

### Animation Notes
- Walk cycle should feel **powerful and forward-driving**. More bounce than Yorkshire.
- The topline has a slight roll to it — the muscle moves.
- Drooping ears should bounce with movement — a secondary animation layer.
- Breathing: deeper, more visible rib expansion than Yorkshire.
- When spooked: body lowers, then surges forward. Quick acceleration. Hard to recover.
- Color shading: use 3-4 shades of red. Muscle definition through color, not line.

## Breeding Value

### As Sire
- **Best terminal sire in the game.** Muscle and growth rate are elite.
- Duroc × Yorkshire is the gold standard market hog cross
- Duroc × Hampshire produces explosive muscle but can be hot-tempered
- Duroc × Berkshire produces excellent meat quality

### As Dam
- Moderate maternal ability. 5/10 fertility means smaller litters.
- Duroc dams grow fast but may not milk well enough for large litters
- Not recommended as primary maternal line unless crossed with Yorkshire/Landrace

### Genetic Tendencies
- High variance on muscle traits — some Durocs are monsters, some are average
- Growth rate breeds true — fast Duroc lines stay fast
- Risk: selecting too hard for muscle can compromise structural soundness
- Meat quality (marbling, pH, color) is a hidden Duroc advantage — relevant for premium market buyers
