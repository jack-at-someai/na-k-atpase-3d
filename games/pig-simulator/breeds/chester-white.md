### Why Chester Whites Matter
Chester Whites are the blue-collar breed. They don't get magazine covers. They don't win national conversations about genetics trends. But ask any old-timer which breed they'd want if they could only have one, and a lot of them will say Chester White. They're sound. They last. They raise good litters. And they compete well in crossbred market hog programs where consistency matters more than flash.

## Game Profile

### Difficulty: Intermediate

Chester Whites are the most balanced breed in the game. No extreme strengths, no extreme weaknesses. The challenge is competing against specialists — a Chester White has to be presented perfectly to beat a Duroc on muscle or a Hampshire on eye appeal.

### Game Stats (Base)
| Stat | Value | Range |
|------|-------|-------|
| Muscle | 6/10 | Solid but not elite |
| Leanness | 6/10 | Moderate — good lean-to-fat ratio |
| Growth Rate | 6/10 | Steady, predictable |
| Fertility | 7/10 | Good litter sizes |
| Soundness | 9/10 | Best feet and legs of any breed |
| Temperament | 7/10 | Steady, reliable, patient |

### Ring Behavior AI
- **Walking:** Smooth, consistent gait. No surprises. Steady cadence.
- **Stopping:** Clean stops. Braces competently. Not dramatic, just correct.
- **Turning:** Smooth turns, follows stick pressure faithfully.
- **Under pressure:** Absorbs pressure without overreacting. Steady under stress.
- **Fatigue:** Excellent endurance. Maintains quality of movement throughout long classes.
- **Quirk:** Almost too predictable. Skilled handlers need to add energy to the presentation to avoid looking flat.

### Personality
Chester Whites are the dependable friends you can always count on. They're not exciting. They're not going to make your heart race in the ring. But they show up, they work, and they don't fall apart. In a long class on a hot day when Durocs are bolting and Hampshires are fighting, the Chester White is still walking steady.

### Why Choose Chester White
- You value consistency and reliability in the ring
- You want the most structurally sound pig in the game
- You want a breed that works in both purebred and crossbred programs
- You appreciate the underdog narrative (nobody expects Chester White to win)

### Why Not Chester White
- You need elite muscle expression (Duroc is better)
- You want the most visually striking pig (Chester White is plain white)
- You want extreme maternal capacity (Landrace/Yorkshire are better)

## Sprite Notes

### Silhouette
- **Moderate, balanced body** — not long like Landrace, not compact like Berkshire
- **Drooping ears** — smaller droop than Landrace, but clearly not erect
- **Level topline** — correct and balanced
- **White coloring** — similar to Landrace but shorter body and smaller ears
- **Slightly heavier bone** — legs look sturdier than other white breeds

### Proportions (32×32 base)
- Body length: ~18px (moderate)
- Body depth: ~10px (moderate)
- Leg height: ~8px (sturdy, proportional)
- Ear droop: 1-2px below horizontal (less than Landrace)
- Bone width: legs 1px wider than Yorkshire/Landrace

### Animation Notes
- Walk cycle should feel **steady and level**. No bounce, no sway. Just correct.
- Ear movement: minimal. Small droop ears don't bounce much.
- Breathing: steady, regular rhythm. Nothing dramatic.
- When spooked: brief startle, then immediate recovery. Fastest recovery time of any breed.
- Key visual challenge: distinguishing Chester White from Yorkshire and Landrace. The three white breeds must read differently. Chester White = moderate droop ears, sturdier legs, medium body length.

## Breeding Value

### As Dam
- Strong maternal breed. 7/10 fertility with excellent longevity.
- Chester White dams stay productive for more seasons than most breeds
- Chester White × Duroc produces durable, well-muscled market hogs
- Good backup maternal line to Yorkshire/Landrace

### As Sire
- Adds structural soundness to any cross
- Chester White × Hampshire produces structurally correct, lean market hogs
- Not the first choice for terminal sire, but adds durability

### Genetic Tendencies
- Soundness breeds true — the breed's greatest gift
- Moderate on everything — selection pressure moves traits slowly but surely
- Risk: can drift toward mediocrity without deliberate selection direction
- Longevity is a real advantage in breeding — a CW sow that stays sound for 6+ litters is worth more than a flashy sow that breaks down after 3
