## Real-World Profile

| Attribute | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| **Registry** | CPS (Certified Pedigreed Swine) |
| **Origin** | Butler and Warren Counties, Ohio |
| **Color** | Black with six white points (similar to Berkshire but larger frame) |
| **Primary Use** | Show pig; terminal cross; historically the "big type" breed |
| **Key Strengths** | Frame size, growth potential, raw mass, impressive profile |
| **History** | Once the dominant U.S. breed; experienced a resurgence in show circles |

### Real Trait Profile
- **Backfat:** Moderate to high — carries more condition than lean breeds
- **Loin Muscle Area:** Good — large-framed pigs have raw muscle mass
- **Growth Rate:** Good-fast — big-framed pigs grow quickly
- **Litter Size:** Moderate — not a maternal specialist
- **Frame Size:** The largest of the purebred show breeds

### Why Poland Chinas Matter
Poland Chinas were the dominant breed in America for decades. They fell out of fashion when the industry shifted toward leaner genetics, but they've experienced a show ring renaissance. The modern Poland China is big-framed, heavy-muscled, and imposing. In crossbred market hog programs, Poland China genetics add frame size and mass that smaller breeds can't match.

## Game Profile

### Difficulty: Advanced

Poland Chinas are powerful and assertive. They're the biggest pigs in the game, and they know it. Handling one requires confidence and strength — a Poland China that doesn't respect the handler will do whatever it wants, and there's not much the handler can do about it.

### Game Stats (Base)
| Stat | Value | Range |
|------|-------|-------|
| Muscle | 7/10 | Good raw mass — impressive when profiled |
| Leanness | 4/10 | Carries more condition than lean breeds |
| Growth Rate | 8/10 | Big frame = fast absolute growth |
| Fertility | 5/10 | Moderate litters |
| Soundness | 5/10 | Can be heavy on its feet; soundness varies |
| Temperament | 3/10 | Dominant, assertive, tests boundaries |

### Ring Behavior AI
- **Walking:** Heavy, deliberate steps. You hear this pig coming. Presence.
- **Stopping:** Stops when it wants to. Not when you want it to. Heavy pressure needed.
- **Turning:** Wide turns. Doesn't do tight maneuvers well. Plan your path.
- **Under pressure:** Pushes through light pressure. Responds to firm, confident stick work. Senses hesitation.
- **Fatigue:** Gets winded in long classes. The size works against endurance.
- **Quirk:** Dominant pigs in multi-animal classes. If another pig crowds a Poland China, the Poland China will push it. Can cause disruptions in the ring. Keep space.

### Personality
Poland Chinas are the linebackers. They're big, they're assertive, and they command attention. A well-presented Poland China walking broadside to the judge is an imposing sight — big topline, wide rear, heavy muscled. But they require a handler who projects authority. Kids who are intimidated by their own pig lose every time.

### Why Choose Poland China
- You want the biggest, most imposing pig in the ring
- You enjoy the challenge of handling a dominant animal
- You want to add frame size to your breeding program
- You appreciate the historical significance of the breed

### Why Not Poland China
- You're uncomfortable with assertive animals
- You need lean, trim pigs for certain judges (Poland China condition is a liability)
- You want high fertility (look elsewhere)
- You need structural perfection (big pigs have more soundness issues)

## Sprite Notes

### Silhouette
- **Largest body** in the game — wider and taller than other breeds
- **Drooping ears** — medium size, not as large as Landrace
- **Black coloring** with white points — visually similar to Berkshire but significantly larger
- **Wide stance** — legs set wider apart than other breeds
- **Heavy topline** — thick, wide back

### Proportions (32×32 base)
- Body length: ~20px
- Body depth: ~12px (matches Duroc for deepest)
- Body WIDTH: widest breed — represented by thicker line weights
- Leg height: ~8px but wider-set
- White points: same pattern as Berkshire but larger patches
- Overall mass: should feel 20% bigger than average breed at same scale

### Animation Notes
- Walk cycle should feel **heavy and ground-shaking**. Each step has impact.
- Head carries lower than Hampshire — more bull-like posture.
- Minimal ear bounce (ears are stiff, drooping).
- Breathing: heavy, visible. Sides expand significantly.
- When spooked: doesn't bolt, doesn't freeze. Turns toward the stimulus. Aggressive posture.
- Key distinction from Berkshire: size. Even at 32×32, Poland China must read as bigger. Use wider proportions.

## Breeding Value

### As Sire
- Adds frame size and mass to any cross
- Poland China × Yorkshire produces large, growthy market hogs
- Poland China × Hampshire produces heavy-muscled, lean(er) market hogs
- Risk: can add too much size if the dam is also large-framed

### As Dam
- Not recommended as primary maternal line (5/10 fertility)
- Poland China dams are protective but can crush piglets due to size
- Better used as sire breed in terminal cross programs

### Genetic Tendencies
- Frame size is highly heritable — big PC lines stay big
- Condition (fat cover) can be selected against, but it's a breed tendency
- Risk: structural breakdown under the weight. Feet and leg selection is critical.
- Modern PCs are much leaner than historical stock — the breed has evolved significantly
