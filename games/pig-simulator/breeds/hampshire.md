### Why Hampshires Matter
The Hampshire is the showman's breed. That black-and-white belt is the most recognizable pattern in the swine world. Hampshires are lean, muscular, structurally correct, and *bold* — they have presence in the ring. They're the breed that turns heads at the county fair. They're also the breed that tests your driving skills, because a Hampshire with a strong will is not going where it doesn't want to go.

## Game Profile

### Difficulty: Intermediate

Hampshires require confident handling. They have opinions. They'll test the player's ability to read the pig and apply pressure at the right moment. But when everything clicks, a Hampshire in the ring is the most impressive sight in the game.

### Game Stats (Base)
| Stat | Value | Range |
|------|-------|-------|
| Muscle | 7/10 | Excellent — lean, clean muscling through loin and ham |
| Leanness | 8/10 | Leanest breed; tight, trim appearance |
| Growth Rate | 6/10 | Moderate — not slow, but not Duroc-fast |
| Fertility | 6/10 | Above average; decent litter sizes |
| Soundness | 8/10 | Excellent feet and legs; free-moving |
| Temperament | 4/10 | Strong-willed, bold, independent |

### Ring Behavior AI
- **Walking:** Confident, purposeful stride. Holds its head up. Looks good moving.
- **Stopping:** Resists stopping. When it does brace, it braces *hard* — feet planted, back level, head up. The best brace in the game.
- **Turning:** Fights the inside turn. Wants to go its own direction. Smooth when cooperative, rough when not.
- **Under pressure:** Pushes back against the stick. If you push too hard, it pushes back harder. Light, consistent pressure wins.
- **Fatigue:** Good endurance but gets stubborn when tired. Won't bolt — just stops cooperating.
- **Quirk:** "Tests" the handler in the first minute of every ring session. If you establish control early, the rest flows. If you lose that first exchange, the whole class is a battle.

### Personality
Hampshires are the alpha personalities of the pig world. They know they look good. They have presence. A well-trained Hampshire in the ring moves like it owns the place — head up, belt gleaming, muscles clean. A poorly trained Hampshire in the ring looks like a rodeo. There's no middle ground.

### Why Choose Hampshire
- You want the most visually striking pig in the game
- You're confident in your driving skills
- You want a challenge that rewards mastery
- Colton Hollister shows Hampshires — beating him with his own breed is personal

### Why Not Hampshire
- You're not comfortable reading pig behavior yet (they punish hesitation)
- You want easy ring sessions (Hampshire ring sessions are intense)
- You need top growth rate (Duroc is faster)

## Sprite Notes

### Silhouette
- **Trim, athletic build** — narrower than Duroc, not as long as Yorkshire
- **Erect ears** — similar to Yorkshire but slightly smaller
- **The belt** — white band encircling the body behind the shoulders and extending down the front legs. This is the defining visual element.
- **Black body** with the white belt creates high-contrast silhouette
- **Clean underline** — trim, tight belly

### Proportions (32×32 base)
- Body length: ~17px (most compact of the starter breeds)
- Body depth: ~10px
- Leg height: ~8px (taller relative to body — athletic, upstanding look)
- Belt width: 4-5px band of white centered behind shoulders
- Ears: erect, 2px above head

### Animation Notes
- Walk cycle should feel **proud and upstanding**. Head carried higher than other breeds.
- The belt must be visible and consistent across all frames — this is the breed's identity.
- Movement is tighter, more controlled than Duroc's bounce or Yorkshire's level glide.
- Brace animation: the best in the game. Feet square, back flat, head up, ears forward. 3 frames to full brace.
- When spooked: plants feet and *pushes back*. Doesn't bolt like Duroc — resists. Animation shows front end lowering, leaning into the stick.
- Color contrast: use clean black/white boundary. No gradient on the belt edge.

## Breeding Value

### As Sire
- Excellent for adding leanness and structural correctness to crosses
- Hampshire × Yorkshire produces lean, structurally sound market hogs
- Hampshire × Duroc produces heavy-muscled, lean pigs with presence
- The belt pattern is dominant — Hampshire crosses often show partial belting

### As Dam
- Good maternal ability. 6/10 fertility; decent milk production.
- Hampshire dams are protective. Good mothers.
- Hampshire × Landrace or Hampshire × Yorkshire dams have strong maternal heterosis

### Genetic Tendencies
- Leanness breeds very true — Hampshire lines stay lean across generations
- Structural correctness is a breed strength — less soundness culling needed
- Risk: can get too lean and too trim. Judges want some volume and capacity.
- The belt pattern has its own genetics — poor belt expression is a show fault in purebred classes
