# Berkshire

**The Black Pig. The Gourmet. The Thinker.**

## Real-World Profile

| Attribute | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| **Registry** | ABA (American Berkshire Association) |
| **Origin** | Berkshire, England — one of the oldest identified breeds |
| **Color** | Black with six white points (feet, snout, tail tip) |
| **Primary Use** | Premium meat quality; niche market; show pig |
| **Key Strengths** | Meat quality (pH, color, marbling), flavor, intramuscular fat |
| **Distinction** | The only breed with its own quality certification program (100% Berkshire) |

### Real EPD Ranges (ABA data)
- **Backfat:** -0.04 to +0.06 in (moderate — carries more intramuscular fat)
- **Loin Muscle Area:** +0.05 to +0.35 sq in (moderate)
- **Days to 250:** -3.0 to +5.0 days (slower than Duroc)
- **Number Born Alive:** +0.2 to +1.0 piglets (moderate)
- **Meat Quality (pH, color, marbling):** Berkshire-specific EPDs — the only breed that tracks these

### Why Berkshires Matter
Berkshires are the chefs' breed. Japanese Kurobuta pork is Berkshire. The premium restaurant market pays more for Berkshire pork because of its superior marbling, pH (less pale, less watery), and flavor. In the show ring, Berkshires are the thinking person's breed — not the biggest, not the flashiest, but undeniably *quality*.

## Game Profile

### Difficulty: Advanced

Berkshires are smart, and smart pigs are hard to show. They get bored. They find patterns. They learn that the ring has corners and they can hide there. Showing a Berkshire well requires reading its mood, keeping it engaged, and knowing when to let it think vs. when to push.

### Game Stats (Base)
| Stat | Value | Range |
|------|-------|-------|
| Muscle | 5/10 | Moderate — not a muscle breed |
| Leanness | 4/10 | Carries more fat than other breeds (intentional — it's the marbling) |
| Growth Rate | 5/10 | Slower growing; not built for speed |
| Fertility | 5/10 | Moderate litter sizes |
| Soundness | 7/10 | Good structure; compact and correct |
| Temperament | 3/10 | Intelligent, independent, easily bored |

### Special Stat: Meat Quality — 10/10
Berkshires have a hidden stat no other breed matches. In the game's market/auction system, Berkshire pork commands a premium. This creates an economic advantage that offsets weaker show ring stats.

### Ring Behavior AI
- **Walking:** Smooth but deliberate. Walks at its own pace. Won't be rushed.
- **Stopping:** Stops easily — sometimes too easily. Can plant itself and refuse to move.
- **Turning:** Intelligent turns — it knows the ring layout and anticipates. Can be manipulated if you know its patterns.
- **Under pressure:** Ignores light pressure. Responds to consistent, steady pressure. Panics under harsh pressure.
- **Fatigue:** Low endurance for ring work. Gets bored, not tired. Performance drops when bored.
- **Quirk:** Learns the judge's pattern. After 2-3 laps, a Berkshire will anticipate when the judge is looking and whether it needs to perform. Exploitable by skilled handlers.

### Personality
Berkshires are the college professors of the pig world. They're watching you as much as you're watching them. They don't have the raw athleticism of a Duroc or the bulldozer presence of a Hampshire, but they have *awareness*. A Berkshire that respects its handler is a joy to show. A Berkshire that doesn't respect its handler will make you look like a fool.

### Why Choose Berkshire
- You want the deepest ring behavior in the game (most complex AI)
- You want to build a premium market program (meat quality premium)
- You appreciate the challenge of showing an intelligent animal
- You love the black-with-white-points aesthetic

### Why Not Berkshire
- You want to win on muscle (Duroc/Hampshire are stronger)
- You want easy daily handling (Berkshires test boundaries)
- You're frustrated by pigs that don't cooperate (try Yorkshire first)

## Sprite Notes

### Silhouette
- **Compact, blocky body** — shorter than Yorkshire, not as deep as Duroc
- **Dished face** — slight concave profile to the snout. Distinctive.
- **Erect ears** — small, neat, slightly forward
- **Black body** with white on all four feet, snout, and tail tip (six points)
- **Stocky legs** — shorter, thicker than Hampshire

### Proportions (32×32 base)
- Body length: ~16px (most compact breed)
- Body depth: ~10px
- Leg height: ~7px
- White points: 1-2px on each foot, 2px on snout, 1px on tail
- Dished face: 1px concave curve on snout profile

### Animation Notes
- Walk cycle should feel **deliberate and unhurried**. Weight on each step.
- Head moves more than other breeds — looking around, aware.
- Ear movement: small twitches, forward/back. More ear animation than any other breed.
- Idle: more varied idle animations. Looks left, looks right, sniffs. Not just standing.
- When spooked: freezes first (2 frames), then either bolts or plants. 50/50. Unpredictable.
- The six white points must read clearly against the black body at small scale.

## Breeding Value

### As Sire
- Adds meat quality to any cross — the hidden premium
- Berkshire × Duroc produces the best-tasting pork in the game
- Berkshire × Yorkshire adds quality to a maternal line
- Not typically used as terminal sire in mainstream programs

### As Dam
- Moderate maternal ability. Adequate but not exceptional.
- Berkshire dams are attentive mothers — lower piglet mortality
- Smaller litters mean more milk per piglet — individual piglet quality is high

### Genetic Tendencies
- Meat quality is highly heritable in Berkshires — the premium breeds true
- Growth rate is consistently moderate — hard to breed fast Berkshires
- Risk: too much selection for size can compromise the compact body type that defines the breed
- The six white points have their own genetics — full, clean points are preferred in purebred classes
