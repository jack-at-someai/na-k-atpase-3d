## Real-World Profile

| Attribute | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| **Registry** | NHRA (National Hereford Hog Record Association) |
| **Origin** | Iowa, Nebraska, Missouri (developed from Duroc, Poland China, Chester White) |
| **Color** | Red body with white face, white belly, and white legs (mimics Hereford cattle coloring) |
| **Primary Use** | Heritage breed; small-scale production; show specialty |
| **Key Strengths** | Docility, foraging ability, unique appearance, hardiness |
| **Status** | Rare breed — watch list status with The Livestock Conservancy |

### Real Trait Profile
- **Backfat:** Moderate to high — heritage type, carries condition
- **Loin Muscle Area:** Moderate — not bred for extreme muscling
- **Growth Rate:** Moderate-slow — not commercial pace
- **Litter Size:** Moderate — adequate for smaller operations
- **Docility:** Exceptional — the gentlest of all swine breeds

### Why Hereford Pigs Matter
Hereford hogs are a uniquely American breed developed to look like Hereford cattle — the same red-and-white pattern that symbolizes beef country. They nearly went extinct in the 1980s and have been slowly recovering through dedicated breeders. They're not competitive in mainstream shows, but they're beloved in heritage breed circuits and by small-scale producers who value temperament and hardiness over production extremes.

## Game Profile

### Difficulty: Unlockable (Available Year 5+)

Hereford is the game's rare breed. You can't buy one at the regular auction. You encounter them at a heritage breed showcase — a special event that appears in Year 5 or later. They're not the best at anything competitive, but they're the most rewarding daily companions in the game.

### Game Stats (Base)
| Stat | Value | Range |
|------|-------|-------|
| Muscle | 4/10 | Not a muscle breed |
| Leanness | 3/10 | Carries condition; heritage type |
| Growth Rate | 4/10 | Slow by show standards |
| Fertility | 6/10 | Adequate |
| Soundness | 7/10 | Hardy, sound, built to last |
| Temperament | 10/10 | The gentlest pig in the game. Period. |

### Ring Behavior AI
- **Walking:** Gentle, easy pace. Walks beside you like a dog.
- **Stopping:** Stops immediately when asked. Waits patiently.
- **Turning:** Follows the handler, not the stick. Turn yourself and the pig follows.
- **Under pressure:** Barely needs pressure. A tap is enough. Heavy pressure confuses it.
- **Fatigue:** Low energy but not sluggish. Steady, calm endurance.
- **Quirk:** Looks at the handler, not the judge. The relationship is the Hereford's priority. It trusts you completely, and that trust is visible.

### Personality
Hereford pigs are companion animals in a competition pig's body. They want to be near their person. They don't have the competitive drive of a Hampshire or the restless energy of a Spotted. They're calm, affectionate, and steady. Showing a Hereford feels different from showing any other breed — less like a competition, more like a walk with a friend.

### Why Choose Hereford
- You've played long enough to unlock it and want a different experience
- You want the most rewarding daily care loop (Hereford interactions are unique)
- You want a heritage breed challenge (competing against mainstream breeds with heritage genetics)
- You appreciate rare breeds and conservation

### Why Not Hereford
- You want to win competitive show classes (Hereford genetics are a disadvantage)
- You want to build a commercially viable breeding program
- You want challenge in the ring (Hereford is too cooperative to be challenging)

### How to Unlock
**Heritage Breed Showcase** — A special event that appears in Year 5 or later. A traveling exhibition of rare and heritage breeds comes to a regional show. You meet Hereford breeders, see the pigs, and have the option to acquire one. The price isn't high — the breed is rare enough that breeders are happy to place pigs with serious youth exhibitors.

## Sprite Notes

### Silhouette
- **Medium body** — between Berkshire and Yorkshire in proportions
- **Medium ears** — slightly drooping, not extreme
- **The color pattern is everything:** Red body with white face, white underbelly, and white legs
- **Mimics Hereford cattle** — if you've seen a Hereford cow, you know the look
- **Round, friendly face** with the white blaze

### Proportions (32×32 base)
- Body length: ~17px
- Body depth: ~10px
- Leg height: ~8px
- White face: upper 60% of head is white
- Red body: warm red-brown, similar to Duroc but with white markings
- White legs: below the knee/hock line
- White belly: ventral 30% of body

### Animation Notes
- Walk cycle should feel **gentle and companionable**. Relaxed, easy movement.
- Head turns toward the handler occasionally — a unique behavior not seen in other breeds.
- Ear movement: soft, gentle twitches. Relaxed ear posture.
- Idle: stands quietly. Occasionally looks at handler. May rub against pen fence.
- When spooked: steps closer to handler rather than away. Seeks comfort rather than flight.
- The red-and-white color pattern must read clearly at small scale. Use clean boundaries.

## Breeding Value

### As Sire
- Not typically used in competitive breeding programs
- Hereford × Berkshire produces interesting heritage market hogs
- Adds temperament and hardiness to any cross
- The white face pattern is partially dominant — Hereford crosses often show the blaze

### As Dam
- Adequate maternal ability for small-scale programs
- Hereford dams are exceptional mothers — calm, attentive, low piglet mortality
- Not recommended for commercial-scale production

### Genetic Tendencies
- Temperament breeds very true — the gentleness is genetic
- The Hereford color pattern is distinctive and partially heritable in crosses
- Growth and muscle potential are limited by the breed's heritage genetics
- Conservation value: raising Hereford pigs contributes to breed preservation

## Narrative Role

The Hereford unlock serves a specific story purpose. By Year 5, the player has mastered the competitive breeds. They've won shows, built a program, earned reputation. The Hereford offers a different question: *What if the point isn't winning?*

Showing a Hereford pig at the county fair won't win Grand Champion. But it might be the most satisfying show of the game — because the pig trusts you completely, and the judge can see it, and the crowd can see it, and for one pass around the ring, nothing else matters except the relationship between a kid and an animal.

That's the game's thesis, and the Hereford is where it becomes explicit.
