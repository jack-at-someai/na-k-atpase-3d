# Raising

**The daily loop. Feed, water, observe, train. Every day matters.**

---

## Overview

Between shows, the game is about daily pig care. This is where conditioning happens, where health is managed, where the pig's trust is built. It's the work that makes the show ring possible. Skip it and your pig arrives at the fair underconditioned, stressed, and untrained.

## Daily Routine

### Morning Chores (Required)
| Task | Time | Notes |
|------|------|-------|
| **Feed** | 2 min | Measured amount based on your feeding plan |
| **Water** | 1 min | Check waterer, ensure clean supply |
| **Health check** | 2 min | Visual inspection — movement, appetite, coat condition |
| **Pen clean** | 2 min | Remove waste, add fresh bedding |

### Optional Daily Activities
| Task | Time | Effect |
|------|------|--------|
| **Walk/drive** | 5-10 min | Ring training. Builds pig's composure and handler's skill. |
| **Brush/handle** | 3 min | Builds trust. Improves temperament score. |
| **Weigh** | 2 min | Track growth rate. Adjust feed plan. |
| **Skin care** | 3 min | Oil/condition skin. Improves show-day appearance. |

### Time System
Each in-game day has a limited number of activity slots. You can't do everything every day. Choices matter:
- Training vs. socializing
- Extra feeding attention vs. skin conditioning
- Spending time with one pig vs. distributing across multiple pigs
- The pigs you invest time in perform better. The ones you neglect plateau.

## Feeding System

### The Science (Simplified from NRC/Livestock-Science Data)

Real show pig feeding involves precise lysine:calorie ratios, phase feeding, and body condition management. The game simplifies this to meaningful decisions:

### Feed Types
| Feed | Cost | Effect | When to Use |
|------|------|--------|-------------|
| **Starter** | Medium | High protein, supports early growth | Weaning to 80 lbs |
| **Grower** | Low | Balanced nutrition, steady gains | 80-180 lbs |
| **Finisher** | Medium | Lower protein, controlled condition | 180-250 lbs |
| **Show Feed** | High | Optimized for muscle expression and coat | Last 30 days before show |
| **High Energy** | Medium | Adds condition (fat cover) | Thin pigs needing fill |
| **Lean Gain** | High | Promotes muscle over fat | Pigs carrying too much condition |

### Feeding Decisions
- **Amount:** Too much → fat pig, loses in the ring. Too little → thin pig, lacks presence.
- **Timing:** Feed to hit target weight on show day. 250 lbs at the county fair in August. Work backwards.
- **Adjustments:** If the pig is gaining too fast, reduce energy. Too slow, increase it. Monitor weekly.
- **Supplements:** Vitamin packs, mineral supplements, coat conditioners — small bonuses, real cost.

### Target Weight Window
| Show Level | Weight Range | Penalty |
|-----------|-------------|---------|
| County fair | 230-280 lbs | Under/overweight pigs penalized by judge |
| Regional | 240-270 lbs | Tighter window, more competitive |
| State/National | 245-265 lbs | Precision required |

## Health Management

### Preventive Care
Based on real swine veterinary science (from the livestock-science reference):

| Protocol | Timing | Effect |
|----------|--------|--------|
| **Vaccination** | Weaning + boosters | Prevents major diseases (erysipelas, respiratory) |
| **Deworming** | Every 6-8 weeks | Prevents parasitic growth reduction |
| **Biosecurity** | Ongoing | Isolation protocols after shows/sales |

### Health Events (Random)
| Condition | Frequency | Impact | Treatment |
|-----------|-----------|--------|-----------|
| **Respiratory illness** | Moderate | Reduced growth, poor condition | Antibiotics via Dr. Chen |
| **Lameness** | Low-moderate | Can't show if severe | Rest, anti-inflammatory, maybe vet |
| **Skin conditions** | Moderate | Appearance penalty at show | Medicated wash, treatment |
| **Digestive upset** | Low | Off feed, reduced growth | Electrolytes, diet adjustment |
| **Injury** | Rare | Variable — minor to career-ending | Depends on severity |

### Biosecurity
Going to shows and sales exposes your pigs to pathogens. Post-event protocols:
- **Isolation period** — 14 days after returning from a show
- **Observation** — Watch for symptoms
- **Prevention** — Vaccination before show season
- Neglecting biosecurity can cause herd-wide health breaks — catastrophic

## Training

### Ring Training Loop
Between shows, you practice driving your pig in a training pen. This is a simplified version of the show ring:
- No judge, no competitors
- Just you, the pig, and the stick
- Practice walking, stopping, turning, and bracing
- The pig's training progress accumulates over sessions

### Training Effects
| Training Level | Ring Behavior | Sessions Required |
|---------------|---------------|-------------------|
| **Untrained** | Ignores handler, erratic movement | 0 |
| **Green** | Responds to strong pressure, slow | 5-10 |
| **Trained** | Follows commands reliably | 15-20 |
| **Polished** | Smooth, anticipates handler | 30+ |
| **Show-ready** | Flows with handler, minimal pressure needed | 40+ |

### Training Principles
- **Short sessions are better than long ones** — 10 min productive > 30 min exhausting
- **End on a positive note** — if the pig does something well, stop. Reward it.
- **Consistency matters more than intensity** — training every day for 10 minutes beats training once a week for an hour
- **Each breed trains differently** — Yorkshire learns steadily. Duroc learns fast but forgets if sessions stop. Berkshire learns but tests what it learned.

## Conditioning

### Body Condition Scoring
The game uses a simplified body condition scoring system:

| Score | Description | Show Impact |
|-------|-------------|-------------|
| **1 — Thin** | Ribs visible, hip bones prominent | Heavy penalty — looks unhealthy |
| **2 — Lean** | Ribs barely covered, trim | Good for lean-preferring judges |
| **3 — Ideal** | Ribs covered, smooth, muscular | Optimal for most judges |
| **4 — Heavy** | Fat cover visible, soft | Penalty for most judges |
| **5 — Overfat** | Excessive condition, waddles | Heavy penalty — disqualifies for top placings |

### Condition Management
- Condition is managed through feeding (amount and type)
- Exercise (walking, training) burns condition
- Genetics influence tendency (some breeds/lines carry more condition)
- Target: arrive at the show at BCS 3.0 ± 0.3

### Coat & Skin
- Regular brushing improves coat quality
- Skin oil application gives show-day shine
- Sun exposure without protection can damage light-colored breeds
- Hair clipping is a show-day skill (simplified mini-game)

## The Calendar Integration

Daily raising activities feed directly into the seasonal cycle from [mechanics/SEASONS.md](SEASONS.md):

| Period | Focus |
|--------|-------|
| **Post-weaning (8-12 weeks old)** | Starter feed, health protocols, gentle handling |
| **Growing (12-20 weeks)** | Grower feed, begin training, establish routine |
| **Pre-show (20-26 weeks)** | Finisher/show feed, intense training, conditioning fine-tuning |
| **Show week** | Final prep, weight management, peak conditioning |
| **Post-show** | Rest, evaluate, plan next season |

## Multi-Pig Management

As your operation grows, you manage multiple pigs simultaneously:
- Each pig has individual needs (feed amount, training stage, health status)
- Time allocation becomes strategic — which pig gets extra attention today?
- Pigs you neglect fall behind in training and conditioning
- A well-managed 3-pig show string beats a poorly-managed 6-pig string
- Hire help (unlocks in Year 4+) to handle basic chores, freeing you for training
