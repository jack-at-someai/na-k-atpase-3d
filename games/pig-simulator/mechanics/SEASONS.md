# Seasons

**The calendar is the spine. Everything runs on biological time.**

---

## Overview

The game follows a seasonal loop that mirrors real show pig production cycles. The calendar isn't arbitrary — it's driven by biology. Gestation is 114 days. Pigs grow at ~1.8-2.2 lbs/day. The county fair is in August. Everything works backwards from those constraints.

## The Annual Cycle

### Fall (September - November)

**Theme:** Evaluation and planning.

| Activity | Details |
|----------|---------|
| **Post-fair evaluation** | Review show results. What worked? What didn't? |
| **Breeding decisions** | Select sire × dam pairings for spring litters |
| **Gilt retention** | Decide which females from this year's crop become brood stock |
| **Genetics shopping** | Attend fall production sales. Buy semen or gilts. |
| **Facility prep** | Winterize barns. Prepare farrowing pens. |

**Key event:** Fall production sales at regional auction facilities. This is where elite genetics change hands. The big-name breeders consign their best. Prices are high, quality is high.

### Winter (December - February)

**Theme:** Gestation and quiet preparation.

| Activity | Details |
|----------|---------|
| **Gestation management** | Monitor bred females. Adjust nutrition for body condition. |
| **Facility work** | Build/repair equipment. Heat farrowing rooms. |
| **Education** | Grandpa Earl's stories happen more in winter. Slow season = learning season. |
| **Early farrowing** | Some litters arrive in late winter (bred in early fall) |
| **Feed planning** | Order feed for growing season. Budget for show string. |

**Key event:** Winter can bring health challenges — respiratory illness increases in cold, enclosed barns. Biosecurity and ventilation management matter.

### Spring (March - May)

**Theme:** New life. The litters arrive.

| Activity | Details |
|----------|---------|
| **Farrowing season** | Primary litters born. The year's show string begins here. |
| **Litter management** | Cross-fostering, heat lamps, monitoring milk supply |
| **Weaning** | Piglets weaned at 21-28 days. Transition to starter feed. |
| **Selection** | First evaluation of young pigs. Keep the best. Market the rest. |
| **Early training** | Begin gentle handling of selected show prospects |

**Key event:** Farrowing is the highest-intensity period. Piglet mortality peaks in the first 72 hours. Late-night barn checks are gameplay (alarm clock mini-events).

### Summer (June - August)

**Theme:** Growing, training, showing.

| Activity | Details |
|----------|---------|
| **Growing season** | Pigs on grower/finisher feed. Daily weight tracking. |
| **Intensive training** | Daily ring training sessions. Build toward show readiness. |
| **Conditioning** | Fine-tune body condition for show day. |
| **Show prep** | Skin care, hair management, fitting practice |
| **Early shows** | Some regional shows in June/July before the county fair |

**Key event:** The county fair in August. The culmination of the entire year. Show week is a dedicated game sequence with daily events.

## Show Week (Detailed)

The county fair runs for one week. Each day has specific events:

### Day 1: Arrival & Check-In
- Transport pigs to fairgrounds
- Set up pens in the show barn
- Weight check (must be in class weight range)
- Health inspection by fair veterinarian
- Evening: wash pigs at the wash rack

### Day 2: Showmanship
- Showmanship classes by age division
- You are judged, not the pig
- Tests: control, ring awareness, grooming, presentation
- Winning showmanship builds reputation even if your pig isn't the best

### Day 3: Market Hog Show
- Individual weight classes (lightweight, middleweight, heavyweight)
- The main event for market barrows and gilts
- Multiple classes throughout the day
- Class winners advance to champion drive

### Day 4: Breeding Show
- Purebred breeding classes (if you have registered stock)
- Evaluated on breed character, reproductive potential, structural merit
- Breed champions selected
- Higher stakes — these are the animals that define your program

### Day 5: Champion Drive & Supreme
- Market hog champion drive — class winners compete
- Grand Champion and Reserve Grand Champion selected
- Supreme Drive — champion market hog vs. champion breeding gilt
- The biggest moment in the game's annual cycle

### Day 6: Premium Sale
- Auction of market hogs
- Grand Champion commands the highest price
- All class-placing pigs sell at premium above market price
- Your pig's sale price reflects your reputation + placement + buyer interest

### Day 7: Departure
- Pack up, clean pens, load pigs
- Final conversations with rivals, judges, breeders
- Reflection — what did you learn this year?
- The next cycle begins

## Multi-Year Progression

### Year 1
- One show: county fair
- One pig
- Focus: learning the routine

### Year 2
- County fair + 1-2 jackpot shows
- 2-3 pigs
- Focus: competing seriously

### Year 3
- County fair + regional shows + state fair qualifier
- 3-5 pigs, some homebred
- Focus: breeding program starts

### Year 4
- Full show circuit (5-8 shows)
- 4-6 pigs, majority homebred
- Focus: reputation building

### Year 5+
- National-level shows appear
- 6-10 pigs, all homebred
- Focus: legacy and genetics program
- World Pork Expo and NAILE as ultimate goals

## Weather & Random Events

### Weather Effects
| Condition | Impact |
|-----------|--------|
| **Heat wave** | Pigs stressed, appetite drops, growth slows. Critical in summer. |
| **Cold snap** | Piglet mortality risk. Heating costs increase. |
| **Storms** | Power outage risk (farrowing house heating). Facility damage. |
| **Drought** | Feed prices increase. Hay/bedding scarce. |

### Random Events
| Event | Frequency | Impact |
|-------|-----------|--------|
| **Breeder sale** | Seasonal | Opportunity to buy new genetics |
| **Disease outbreak** | Rare | Quarantine period, potential pig loss |
| **Judge change** | Per show | Different judge = different strategy |
| **Equipment failure** | Occasional | Barn repair needed, diverts time |
| **Unexpected litter quality** | Per farrowing | Great or terrible — genetics are probabilistic |
| **Rival's setback** | Rare | A competitor has a bad year — opportunity |

## Time Compression

### Gameplay Pacing
- **Show week:** 1 day = 1 play session (most detail)
- **Active months (spring/summer):** 1 week = 1 play session
- **Quiet months (winter):** 1 month = 1 play session with event prompts
- Player can always slow down to daily management if desired
- Fast-forward through uneventful periods with summary screens
