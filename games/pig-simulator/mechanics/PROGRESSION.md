# Progression

**You don't level up. You grow up. There's a difference.**

## Philosophy

There is no XP bar. No skill tree. No level number. The player progresses by *getting better at the game* — reading pigs, making breeding decisions, presenting in the ring. The game's systems reveal depth over time, and the player's understanding deepens through experience.

This mirrors real show pig culture: nobody tells a kid they're "Level 12" at showing. They just start seeing things they didn't see before.

## Reputation System

### How Reputation Works
Reputation is the game's primary progression metric. It's earned through:

| Action | Reputation Impact |
|--------|-------------------|
| Show placement (class winner) | ++ |
| Show placement (top 5) | + |
| Grand/Reserve Champion | +++ |
| Showmanship winner | ++ |
| Sell breeding stock (high price) | + |
| Sell breeding stock (buyer wins with your genetics) | +++ |
| Consistent show attendance | + |
| Health break in your herd | -- |
| Poorly conditioned pig at show | - |
| Unsportsmanlike behavior | -- |

### Reputation Tiers

| Tier | Name | Unlock |
|------|------|--------|
| 0 | **Unknown** | Starting state. Nobody knows you. |
| 1 | **Newcomer** | Show at the county fair. People learn your name. |
| 2 | **Competitor** | Place consistently. Rivals take you seriously. |
| 3 | **Contender** | Win classes. Breeders notice your stock. |
| 4 | **Known Program** | Sell breeding stock. People seek you out. |
| 5 | **Respected Breeder** | Win champion drives. Your herdmark has weight. |
| 6 | **County Legend** | Multi-year dominance. You are what your grandpa was. |
| 7 | **Regional Force** | Compete at state level. Your genetics travel. |
| 8 | **National Competitor** | Show at NAILE/World Pork Expo. The big stage. |

### Reputation Effects
- **Auction prices** — Higher reputation = higher sale prices for your stock
- **Genetics access** — Elite breeders sell to known programs, not unknowns
- **Judge awareness** — Judges at small shows notice known programs (subtle bias, mirrors reality)
- **NPC dialogue** — Characters treat you differently as reputation grows
- **Grandpa Earl** — Opens up progressively as reputation increases

## Knowledge Unlocks

As the player gains experience, the game reveals hidden information:

### Year 1 — Basic Vision
- Pig stats are hidden. You see the pig, not numbers.
- Feed types are limited (starter, grower, finisher).
- You can ask your parent about your pig ("Is it gaining enough?").
- Show scoring is hidden — you see placement, not why.

### Year 2 — Developing Eye
- Body Condition Score becomes visible (you learn to read it).
- Growth rate graph appears (weekly weigh-in data).
- Judge preference hints appear ("Judge Reeves watched feet carefully...").
- Composure meter appears during training sessions.
- Feed options expand (show feed, supplements).

### Year 3 — Breeder's Eye
- EPDs visible on breeding stock (you learn what they mean).
- Predicted offspring ranges shown for proposed matings.
- Structural evaluation overlay (visual guides on what to look for).
- Pedigree viewer for owned animals.
- You can evaluate other people's pigs with increasing accuracy.

### Year 4 — The Whole Picture
- Full genetic data visible.
- Inbreeding coefficient warnings.
- Historical breeding records and genetic trends.
- Judge scoring breakdown after shows.
- Market trend data (what traits are selling well).

### Year 5+ — Earl's Eye
- Intuition hints — the game occasionally highlights things before you'd notice them yourself.
- "This piglet has something." A flash of grandpa's instinct. Not always right, but worth watching.
- By now, the player should genuinely be able to evaluate pigs by sight. The game trusts them.

## Difficulty Curve

### What Gets Harder
- **Competition quality** — rival pigs improve each year
- **Judge expectations** — higher-level shows have stricter judging
- **Breeding complexity** — managing multiple lines, avoiding inbreeding
- **Time pressure** — more pigs, more daily tasks, same number of hours
- **Reputation maintenance** — one bad year at the top hurts more than a bad year at the bottom

### What Gets Easier
- **Ring mechanics** — the player genuinely improves at driving
- **Pig reading** — the player learns to see conformation
- **Breeding decisions** — pattern recognition develops over multiple litters
- **Daily routine** — efficiency improves, muscle memory develops
- **Genetics access** — reputation unlocks better breeding stock

### The Sweet Spot
Years 3-5 are designed to be the most engaging stretch:
- Breeding is new and exciting
- Competition is challenging but winnable
- Reputation is growing but not settled
- The herdmark decision gives the story its emotional peak
- The player is competent enough to appreciate depth, but not so experienced that it's routine

## No Fail State

The game cannot be "lost." There is no game over. If your pig gets sick, you treat it. If you lose at the fair, you try next year. If your breeding program produces a bad litter, you adjust.

**The only true failure is quitting.** And the game is designed so that you never want to — because next season's litter might be the one. The next show might be yours. The genetics you're building are starting to click. There's always a reason to play one more season.

This is how real show pig breeding works. Nobody quits after one bad year. The loop is the game.
