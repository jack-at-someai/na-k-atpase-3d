# Characters

## Family

### Earl Wilder — Grandpa
**Role:** Passive mentor, living legend
**Herdmark:** WLD
**Breed:** Yorkshire (purist — never crossed, never apologized)
**Personality:** Quiet, dry humor, speaks in stories. Won't give direct advice until you've earned it. Has a way of saying something at breakfast that you don't understand until you're standing in the barn at midnight and suddenly it clicks.
**In-game function:** Unlockable dialogue tiers. As your reputation grows, Earl opens up. His stories contain embedded gameplay knowledge — breeding ratios, judging preferences, ring strategy. The player has to extract the lesson.
**Key quote:** *"A pig don't know it's supposed to win. You're the one who has to know."*

### Your Parent (Mom or Dad — player chooses)
**Role:** Operational guide, tutorial voice
**Breed:** Runs a mixed program — Yorkshires (Earl's legacy) plus some Durocs and crossbreds
**Personality:** Patient, practical, slightly overshadowed by Earl's legacy. Knows the science but relies on structure more than instinct. Good at the business side.
**In-game function:** Teaches daily mechanics, manages the farm calendar, handles the budget. The player can ask questions.
**Key quote:** *"Your grandpa could look at a pig and just know. I look at the numbers. Both work. Find your way."*

## Mentors

### Dale Morrison — Feed Store Owner
**Role:** Quest giver, information hub, community anchor
**Age:** Late 50s
**Background:** Former showman who aged out of the ring and into retail. Knows every breeder in three counties. His store is where deals get made.
**Personality:** Talkative, generous with advice (sometimes too generous), keeps a mental ledger of everyone's breeding program. Gossips freely.
**In-game function:** Provides quests ("I heard the Trogdon farm is selling some bred gilts — might be worth a look"), sells supplies, and relays information about upcoming shows, judge assignments, and rival movements.
**Key quote:** *"You know what the difference is between a $500 pig and a $5,000 pig? About three generations of somebody who gave a damn."*

### Dr. Pauline Chen — Veterinarian
**Role:** Health advisor, emergency support, science voice
**Age:** Early 40s
**Background:** Large animal vet, Iowa State grad. Moved to Calloway County because she wanted to work with people who actually cared about their animals. Treats everything from show pigs to dairy cows.
**Personality:** Direct, unsentimental, deeply competent. Will tell you what's wrong with your pig and what it'll cost to fix it. Doesn't sugarcoat.
**In-game function:** Handles health events (illness, injury, reproductive complications). Teaches veterinary knowledge progressively. Becomes critical during farrowing season.
**Key quote:** *"I can save this pig, but you need to understand why it got sick in the first place."*

## Rivals

### Colton Hollister — The Natural
**Role:** Primary rival, mirror character
**Age:** Same as protagonist
**Background:** Third-generation showman, just like you. But where your family's reputation dimmed, the Hollisters kept winning. Colton's dad is the county's most consistent breeder. Colton grew up in the barn.
**Breed:** Hampshire and Crossbred
**Personality:** Not a bully. Quietly confident. Respects the animal. The rivalry is competitive, not personal — which makes it harder. You can't hate him because he's doing everything right.
**In-game function:** Benchmark opponent. Colton's pigs set the standard you're trying to meet. Beating him feels earned because he's genuinely good.
**Key quote:** *"Good luck out there. Pig looks decent."* (This is high praise from Colton.)

### Sierra Dawson — The Strategist
**Role:** Secondary rival, genetics-focused
**Age:** 1-2 years older than protagonist
**Background:** Sierra doesn't have the biggest operation, but she's the smartest buyer in the county. She studies EPDs, tracks bloodlines, and makes crosses nobody else sees coming.
**Breed:** Duroc and Berkshire specialist
**Personality:** Analytical, competitive, occasionally arrogant. Treats breeding like chess. Sometimes so focused on genetics that she neglects the daily care side.
**In-game function:** Introduces the player to the depth of the genetics system. Her pigs are well-bred but sometimes poorly conditioned — showing that genetics alone doesn't win.
**Key quote:** *"Your pig's sire has a -0.3 on backfat EPD. That's not going to work at state."*

### Tyler McAllister — The Money
**Role:** Tertiary rival, cautionary tale
**Age:** Same as protagonist
**Background:** The McAllisters are the richest family in the county. Tyler's dad buys the most expensive pigs at every sale. Tyler shows up with genetics that cost more than your family's truck.
**Breed:** Whatever's fashionable — changes yearly
**Personality:** Not mean, just oblivious. Doesn't understand why his $8,000 pig doesn't always win. Hasn't put in the daily work. His pigs are well-bred but poorly shown.
**In-game function:** Demonstrates that money can't buy feel. Tyler occasionally beats you with raw genetic quality, which stings — but he never builds a program because he doesn't understand *why* his pigs win when they do.
**Key quote:** *"Dad said this one's got Grand Champion written all over it."* (It doesn't.)

## Judges

Judges rotate through shows. Each has known preferences — just like real judges.

### Judge Martha "Marty" Reeves
**Emphasis:** Structural correctness above all. Will pin a sound, moderate pig over a big, flawed one every time.
**Tells:** Watches feet and legs during the drive. Asks exhibitors to stop frequently.
**How to win:** Drive slow, keep the pig moving fluidly, no limping or toeing out.

### Judge Bo Carver
**Emphasis:** Muscle and volume. Wants big, powerful pigs that fill a profile.
**Tells:** Steps back and profiles the line frequently. Loves a deep-sided, heavy-muscled pig.
**How to win:** Present your pig broadside when he's looking. Keep the pig squared up.

### Judge Elena Ruiz
**Emphasis:** Balance and eye appeal. Values the total package — nothing too extreme.
**Tells:** Moves around the ring, views from multiple angles. Doesn't focus on one trait.
**How to win:** Consistent presentation from all angles. No one thing has to be elite, but nothing can be bad.

### Judge Carl Dunham
**Emphasis:** Growth and lean expression. Wants pigs that look like they'll yield well.
**Tells:** Handles pigs along the topline. Asks about weight and age.
**How to win:** Have your pig conditioned lean. Topline muscling visible. Right weight for frame size.
