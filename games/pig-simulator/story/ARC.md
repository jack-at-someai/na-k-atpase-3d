# Story Arc

## The Shape of the Story

This is not a linear narrative with cutscenes. It's a **seasonal loop with emergent narrative** — the story happens because the systems create it. But the world has a dramatic spine that gives the player's journey shape and stakes.

The central question: **Can you earn the herdmark?**

---

## Year 1 — The First Pig

### Setup
You attend your first breeder sale with your parent. Budget is tight. You pick a pig from the back pen — not the best, not the worst. You name it. You take it home.

### The Learning Season
- Daily chores: feed, water, clean pen, walk the pig
- Learn to use the driving stick — the pig doesn't cooperate at first
- Parent teaches basic health checks and feeding schedules
- Grandpa Earl watches from the porch. Says little.

### County Fair
- **Showmanship class** — You're judged, not the pig. Can you control it? Do you know where the judge is? Are you smooth?
- **Market class** — Your pig competes against others. You probably place middle of the pack. Colton Hollister wins.
- **Post-show** — The auction. Your pig sells. You feel something about that, and the game lets you sit with it.

### Year 1 Lessons
- Showing is about the relationship, not the animal's raw quality
- Daily consistency matters more than show-day heroics
- The county fair is a community, not just a competition

---

## Year 2 — Seeing Clearly

### New Decisions
- You pick your own pig this year (with guidance)
- You start making feeding decisions — what feed, how much, when to adjust
- Dale Morrison at the feed store starts giving you real tasks
- Dr. Chen teaches you to recognize early health issues

### The Genetics Conversation
- Grandpa Earl tells you a story about a sow he had thirty years ago. How she threw champions in three consecutive litters. How the line died because he sold the wrong gilt.
- You start understanding that *selection is everything* — the pig you keep is more important than the pig you show
- Sierra Dawson beats you with a Duroc that has half the condition of your pig but twice the genetics. It stings.

### County Fair — Year 2
- Show 2-3 pigs
- Win a class (or come close)
- Showmanship: you're getting smoother, the pig trusts you
- You start seeing what the judge sees — why certain pigs pin over others

### Year 2 Lessons
- Genetics set the ceiling; management reaches it
- Observation is a skill that improves with practice
- The rivalry with Colton is real now — you're competitive, not just participating

---

## Year 3 — The Breeder

### The Big Decision
- Your parent offers you a gilt from the family herd
- You choose a sire — from the available boars in the county, or an AI sire from a catalog
- This is your first breeding decision. It defines the next generation.
- Grandpa Earl actually comes to the barn to look at your gilt. Says one sentence. It matters.

### Farrowing Season
- 114 days of waiting
- The litter arrives — some good, some average, some culls
- You select your keepers. This is harder than it sounds.
- You raise them. They're *yours* — your genetics, your decisions.

### Expanding the Network
- You attend a regional show for the first time
- The competition is harder. State-caliber pigs.
- You meet breeders from outside the county who have genetics you've never seen
- Unlock new breeds (Berkshire, Chester White, Landrace)

### County Fair — Year 3
- Show your homebred pigs for the first time
- Colton shows a Hampshire that's the best pig in the county. Maybe you beat him. Maybe not.
- But you're showing pigs *you bred*, and that changes everything.
- Other breeders start asking about your stock.

### Year 3 Lessons
- Breeding is a bet on the future — you won't know if you chose right for 8+ months
- Your own stock carries your reputation now
- The herdmark conversation starts — Earl mentions it for the first time

---

## Year 4 — The Program

### Building Something
- Multiple sows now. Planned matings every season.
- You sell breeding stock for the first time. Your reputation sets the price.
- Tyler McAllister's dad tries to buy your best gilt. You have to decide: sell for good money, or keep her in the program.
- You're not just showing pigs — you're running a breeding program.

### The Regional Circuit
- Compete at 3-4 shows beyond the county fair
- Each show has different judges with different preferences
- You learn to match your pigs to the judge, not just bring your best one every time

### The Herdmark Decision
- Grandpa Earl gives you a choice: use the WLD mark, or register your own
- Using WLD carries his legacy — and his expectations
- Registering your own means starting fresh — but it's *yours*
- This is the game's biggest narrative fork

### Year 4 Lessons
- A breeding program is a living thing — it has momentum, direction, and risk
- Your decisions from Year 2-3 are bearing fruit (or consequences) now
- The game is no longer about one pig. It's about a herd.

## Year 5+ — The Legacy

### Endgame Goals (not a true ending — the loop continues)
- **County Champion** — Win Grand Champion at the Calloway County Fair
- **State Competitor** — Place top 5 at the state fair
- **National Qualifier** — Earn entry to NAILE or World Pork Expo
- **Breeding Reputation** — Have your stock sought after by other breeders
- **Grandpa's Approval** — This isn't a quest flag. It's a feeling. You walk into the barn and Earl is standing there, watching one of your pigs, and he nods. That's it. That's the ending.

### The Infinite Loop
The game doesn't end. Generations of pigs continue. You can play indefinitely, chasing better genetics, harder shows, and deeper understanding. Every litter is a new possibility. Every show is a new test. The loop rewards patience with depth — and the player who has been playing for five in-game years sees the world completely differently than the player in Year 1.

## Narrative Design Principles

1. **Show, don't tell.** The game teaches through experience, not exposition. Grandpa's stories contain lessons, but you have to extract them.
2. **Failure is content.** Losing a show, having a bad litter, making a wrong breeding decision — these are story beats, not punishment.
3. **No villains.** Rivals are competitors. Judges have preferences, not biases. The world is fair in the way that livestock judging is fair — subjective, but consistent.
4. **The animal is real.** The pig is not a tool. It has behavior, preference, and agency. The game's emotional core is the human-animal relationship.
5. **Time teaches.** The player's skill growth should mirror the character's. By Year 4, the player should genuinely understand what makes a good show pig — and that knowledge was earned through play, not menus.
