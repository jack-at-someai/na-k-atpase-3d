# The World

## Calloway County

A fictional rural county in the American Midwest. Rolling hills, white fences, red barns. Corn on one side of the road, beans on the other. The kind of place where everyone knows your truck before they know your name — and they know your grandpa's truck better than yours.

Calloway County runs on livestock. Always has. The dairy farms are mostly gone now. The cattle operations consolidated. But the hog barns — the show barns, the seedstock operations, the families that have been breeding registered pigs for three, four, five generations — those are still here. And in Calloway County, those families are royalty.

## The Social Fabric

### The Fair

The Calloway County Fair is the center of gravity. It runs for one week every August, but the entire year revolves around it. Kids start planning their show string in October. Breeders time their farrowing dates to hit the right weight windows. Feed store orders spike in April. The fairgrounds — a permanent facility with show barns, a covered arena, and a livestock auction ring — is the most important building in the county.

The fair has **market hog classes** (where your pig is judged on its merit as a meat animal), **breeding gilt classes** (judged on reproductive potential and structural correctness), **showmanship classes** (where the kid is judged, not the pig), and **supreme drive** (the final showdown between class winners).

### The Feed Store — Tractor Supply + Tavern

**Morrison's Feed & Supply** is the nerve center. It's where breeders gossip, where kids pick up show supplies, where sale flyers get posted on the corkboard, and where the old-timers sit on overturned buckets and tell stories about pigs that won twenty years ago.

In-game, Morrison's functions as:
- **Quest hub** — The owner, Dale Morrison, gives you tasks and tips
- **Supply shop** — Feed, supplements, show supplies, equipment
- **Information board** — Upcoming shows, breeder sales, breeding stock available
- **Social space** — NPC conversations that reveal lore, judge preferences, rival strategies

### The Auction Ring

**Calloway Livestock Auction** runs special show pig sales throughout the year. This is where genetics change hands. A bred gilt from a champion line might sell for thousands. A market barrow prospect might go for $200 or $2,000 depending on its pedigree and visual appraisal.

The auction is where you:
- Buy new genetics to bring into your program
- Sell stock you've raised (reputation affects price)
- Observe what other breeders value (market intelligence)
- Occasionally find a diamond in the rough

### The Vet Clinic

**Dr. Pauline Chen's Large Animal Practice** handles everything from routine vaccinations to emergency C-sections. She's practical, no-nonsense, and the only person in the county who'll tell your grandpa he's wrong about anything.

In-game, the vet clinic is:
- **Health management** — Vaccination schedules, deworming, illness treatment
- **Reproductive services** — Pregnancy checks, farrowing assistance, AI services
- **Education** — Dr. Chen teaches you about animal health as you encounter problems

### The Fairgrounds

A permanent facility with:
- **Show arena** — Covered, with bleachers. Sawdust floor. Where the showring gameplay happens.
- **Wash rack** — Where you prep pigs on show morning
- **Show barns** — Temporary pens where your pigs stay during fair week
- **Auction pavilion** — Where the premium sale happens after the show

## The Culture

### Herdmarks

Every registered breeder has a **herdmark** — a unique letter code assigned by the breed registry. Your grandpa's herdmark is legendary in the county. When people see that prefix on a registration paper, it means something. Part of the game's arc is earning the right to use it — or establishing your own.

This mirrors real-world NSR/ABA/CPS herdmark systems from the Sounder data. In the game's universe, a herdmark is like a family crest.

### Generational Knowledge

The game's deepest theme. Your grandpa could walk into a farrowing barn and tell you which piglet in the litter would be the one. He couldn't always explain why. It was feel — decades of observation compressed into instinct.

That knowledge is what you're trying to learn. The game teaches it through experience: after enough seasons, you start seeing what he saw. The game never tells you the genetics outright — you have to learn to read the animal.

### The Rivalry System

Calloway County has families, and families have histories. The Hollisters have been beating your family at the fair for two years. The Dawson kid has a boar from the same bloodline your grandpa used to win with. The McAllister operation buys the most expensive genetics every year and sometimes it works and sometimes it doesn't, and that's the whole point.

Rivals aren't villains. They're competitors. Some are gracious. Some aren't. But they all respect the animal, because in this world, the animal is the truth.

## The Calendar

The world follows a seasonal rhythm that mirrors real show pig production:

| Season | Activity |
|--------|----------|
| **Fall** | Breeding decisions. Select sire × dam pairings. |
| **Winter** | Gestation. 3 months, 3 weeks, 3 days (114 days). Facility prep. |
| **Spring** | Farrowing. Piglets born. Selection begins at weaning. |
| **Summer** | Growing season. Feed, train, condition. |
| **Late Summer** | Fair season. Show week. The culmination. |
| **Early Fall** | Post-show. Evaluate results. Plan next year's matings. |

This loop repeats, and each cycle you know more, have better genetics, and face harder competition.

## Tone

Not cynical. Not saccharine. The world is hard but good. Animals die sometimes. You lose shows you should have won. Your best-bred litter produces nothing special. But then one morning you walk into the barn and there's a piglet standing in the corner of the pen with its head up and its back perfectly level and you just *know*. That's the one.

The game should feel like early morning in a hog barn — quiet, warm, purposeful.
