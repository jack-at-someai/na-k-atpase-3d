# The Protagonist

## Who You Are

A kid. 10 to 14 years old — the player chooses. Boy or girl — the player chooses. The game plays identically either way. In the show pig world, the ring doesn't care about gender. It cares about your pig and how you present it.

You live on your family's farm in Calloway County. Your bedroom has a ribbon board on the wall — but the ribbons are your mom's and your grandpa's. Yours is empty. Not for long.

## The Family

### Grandpa — Earl Wilder

The legend. Herdmark: **WLD**. Earl Wilder showed Yorkshires for forty years and never once apologized for it. He won Grand Champion at the county fair eleven times. He won at the state fair twice. He had a line of Yorkshire sows that other breeders would drive two states to buy gilts from.

Earl is alive but retired. Bad knees. Can't get around the barn the way he used to. He sits in his recliner and watches the farm through the kitchen window. He doesn't give advice easily — you have to earn it. But when he does talk, you listen, because the man has forgotten more about pigs than most people will ever learn.

Earl's role in the game:
- **Mentor (passive)** — He won't tell you what to do. He'll tell you stories that contain lessons.
- **Reputation anchor** — The WLD herdmark opens doors. People give you a chance because of him.
- **Late-game unlock** — As you prove yourself, Earl starts sharing real knowledge — the kind that doesn't come from books.

### Mom/Dad — The Operation

Your parent (player picks which one is the primary) keeps the farm running. They have a day job in town but maintain a 20-sow operation — enough to be a seedstock supplier, not enough to be commercial. They're competent but not exceptional. They know the science but don't have Earl's eye.

Parent's role:
- **Tutorial guide** — Teaches you the basics of daily care, feeding, health
- **Operational constraint** — You share barn space, feed budget, and time with the family operation
- **Emotional anchor** — The parent wants you to love this, not just do it

### The Other Parent

Works in town. Supportive but doesn't have the livestock background. Provides the grounded "normal life" counterbalance. Occasionally asks questions that force you to explain what you're learning (which reinforces the player's understanding).

## Your First Pig

The game begins when your parent takes you to a **breeder sale**. Not the fancy ones — a local producer clearing out some stock. You're there to pick your first show pig.

The catch: you can't afford the good ones. Your budget gets you a pig from the back pen — the ones the breeder almost didn't bring. Your parent helps you evaluate them, but the final pick is yours.

**The first pig is deliberately not great.** It's sound, it's healthy, but it's not going to win Grand Champion at the county fair. That's the point. The first pig teaches you to show, not to win. It teaches you that a well-presented average pig beats a poorly-presented good pig. It teaches you that showing is about the relationship, not the ribbon.

The first pig's breed is chosen by the player from the starter breeds:
- **Yorkshire** — Beginner-friendly. Calm temperament. Forgiving in the ring.
- **Duroc** — Slightly harder. More athletic. Rewards good driving.
- **Hampshire** — Medium difficulty. Strong-willed but flashy when driven well.

Other breeds unlock as you progress.

## Character Progression

### Year 1: The Novice
- Learn to walk a pig with a driving stick
- Understand basic feeding and care
- Compete in showmanship (where *you* are judged)
- Show your first market hog at the county fair
- Probably don't win, and that's okay

### Year 2: The Student
- Start making your own feeding decisions
- Learn to evaluate conformation (the visual assessment of a pig's structure)
- Begin understanding genetics through your grandpa's stories
- Show 2-3 pigs at the county fair
- Maybe win a class. Maybe not.

### Year 3: The Breeder
- Make your first breeding decision (select a sire for a family gilt)
- Raise your first litter
- Select from your own stock for the first time
- Begin building a reputation with other breeders
- Compete at a regional show

### Year 4+: The Program
- Multiple sows, planned matings, deliberate genetic direction
- Sell breeding stock to other operations
- Compete at state and national level shows
- Earn the right to use the WLD herdmark — or forge your own

## The Player's Skill Growth

The game doesn't have a traditional XP system. The *player* gets better, not just the character. Over time:

- You learn to read a pig's stance and predict how it will move
- You recognize good conformation by sight, not by stats
- You understand which crosses produce which results
- You develop "the eye" — the same instinct Earl has

This is the game's deepest design goal: **the player should become a better judge of pigs by playing.** The game teaches real evaluation skills through repeated exposure and meaningful consequence.
