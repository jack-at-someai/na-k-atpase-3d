# Against the Storm — Systems Guide for Charlotte

> A study of multi-species management infrastructure through the lens of a roguelite city builder.

---

## Purpose

Against the Storm is a roguelite city builder by Eremite Games where you manage settlements populated by five distinct species, each with their own needs, specializations, and resolve mechanics. The game is a working simulation of **intraspecies management** — the art of keeping multiple species alive and productive within shared infrastructure under environmental pressure.

This folder documents the game's systems to expose structural resonance with Charlotte's substrate architecture. The goal is not to build a game tool. The goal is to show that Against the Storm's design — arrived at independently by game designers solving engagement problems — converges on the same patterns Charlotte uses to model observable reality.

If a fantasy city builder and a swine management substrate land on the same architecture, that architecture is real.
