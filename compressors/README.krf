;;; COMPRESSOR — US COMPRESSED AIR INDUSTRY SUBSTRATE
;;; ================================================================
;;;
;;; This is the Charlotte container for the compressed air industry.
;;; It boots on top of charlotte-os and extends the five primitives
;;; with domain-specific types, predicates, and knowledge.
;;;
;;; PURPOSE
;;; -------
;;; Built for ISG's Charlotte deployment (Industrial Air Power +
;;; Industrial Air Centers). Provides the complete ontological
;;; backbone for competitive pricing intelligence, product catalog
;;; management, and customer reactivation across the US compressed
;;; air equipment market.
;;;
;;; DOMAIN
;;; ------
;;; The compressed air industry covers:
;;;   - Air compressor manufacturing and distribution
;;;   - Air treatment (dryers, filtration, condensate management)
;;;   - Vacuum pump systems (industrial, scientific, medical)
;;;   - Blower systems (regenerative, rotary)
;;;   - Nitrogen generation (PSA, membrane)
;;;   - Air storage and piping infrastructure
;;;   - Parts, lubricants, and accessories
;;;   - Service and maintenance operations
;;;
;;; CONVEX HULL
;;; -----------
;;; This substrate's convex hull covers every operation in the
;;; compressed air market where identities emit signals over time:
;;;
;;;   Manufacturer → produces Product → sold by Distributor
;;;   Distributor  → lists Product at Price → bought by Customer
;;;   Customer     → operates Equipment → requires Service
;;;   Equipment    → emits Metrics (CFM, PSI, hours) → triggers Alerts
;;;   Price        → changes over Time → reveals Market Dynamics
;;;
;;; Every actor in this chain is a NODE. Every connection is an EDGE.
;;; Every measurement is a METRIC. Every event is a SIGNAL.
;;; Every expectation is a PROTOCOL.
