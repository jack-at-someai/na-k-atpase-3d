# SomeAI — Revenue Forecast & Series A Pipeline

**Prepared:** February 2026
**Classification:** Strategic — Internal / Investor Use
**Entity:** SomeAI (engineering & research arm of Richard Enterprises)

---

## I. Current Revenue Position

SomeAI has exactly one active revenue-generating contract as of February 2026.

### Active Contract: Industrial Service Group (ISG)

| Component | Terms | Annual Value |
|-----------|-------|-------------|
| Deployment & migration | One-time, TBD scope | TBD (estimated $150K–$300K) |
| Ongoing managed service | $40,000/mo, 2-year lock | **$480,000/yr** |
| **Confirmed ARR** | | **$480,000** |

ISG is PE-backed and provides its own contracts. This is the proof-of-concept that validates Charlotte's managed service model at industrial scale. Live date: February 23, 2026.

### Owned Entity: Sounder

Sounder is SomeAI's first-party livestock genetics platform. Jack is CTO; Charles Logan McDaniel is CEO. Sounder generates no revenue to SomeAI — it is an owned division. Sounder's value is strategic: it is the vehicle through which Charlotte deploys into the swine industry, farm by farm.

**Sounder's strategic value:** Access to 65,000+ registered breeders, NSR/CPS/TSA registry partnerships, and the BarnOS deployment model that stitches the industry together at the genetic layer.

## II. Contract Pipeline — Managed Service Clients

Every business below has a completed onboarding package (competitive analysis, KRF substrate, brand book, MSA). Contract values are from drafted MSAs. All contracts follow the double-contract model: Foundation Phase (deployment/migration) + Operations Phase (ongoing managed service), 24 months total.

### Tier 1: Enterprise Clients ($10K+/mo operations phase)

| Client | Industry | Est. Revenue | Foundation | Operations | 2yr Contract Value |
|--------|----------|-------------|------------|------------|-------------------|
| **CardVault** (Tom Brady) | Sports cards & collectibles retail | $25M–$50M | $10,000/mo × 6mo | $25,000/mo × 18mo | **$510,000** |

**CardVault thesis:** 12 locations across 9 states, 338% growth over 3 years. Charlotte unifies inventory intelligence, pricing signals, and collector demand patterns across all locations. No competitor in the collectibles space has a unified operating substrate.

### Tier 2: Growth Clients ($5K–$10K/mo operations phase)

| Client | Industry | Est. Revenue | Foundation | Operations | 2yr Contract Value |
|--------|----------|-------------|------------|------------|-------------------|
| **Wendt Group** | Online show pig auctions | $4M–$6M | $3,500/mo × 6mo | $7,500/mo × 18mo | **$156,000** |
| **SC Online Sales** | Multi-species livestock auctions | $2M–$4M | $3,000/mo × 6mo | $6,500/mo × 18mo | **$135,000** |

**Wendt thesis:** ShowPig.com is the dominant online auction platform. Charlotte makes every auction, every bid, every animal traceable through the substrate — creating the first observable auction intelligence layer in livestock.

**SCO thesis:** Multi-species auction platform (cattle, sheep, goats, pigs, equine). Charlotte connects auction data to pedigree, health, and performance signals across species boundaries. No existing platform does cross-species analytics.

### Tier 3: Foundation Clients ($2K–$5K/mo operations phase)

| Client | Industry | Est. Revenue | Foundation | Operations | 2yr Contract Value |
|--------|----------|-------------|------------|------------|-------------------|
| **All State Manufacturing** | Metal fixtures / micro markets | ~$2.2M | $2,500/mo × 6mo | $5,000/mo × 18mo | **$105,000** |
| **Top Tier Moving** | Interstate moving & relocation | ~$14.4M | $2,000/mo × 6mo | $4,500/mo × 18mo | **$93,000** |

**All State thesis:** Nobody at the fixture layer has a data strategy. Charlotte makes manufacturing, inventory, and fulfillment observable at the layer where every competitor is blind. Proof-of-concept value exceeds revenue contribution.

**Top Tier thesis:** 10,606 jobs, 98 crew, $14.4M billed — and operations run on phone calls and spreadsheets. Charlotte surfaces crew performance trajectories, route optimization signals, and customer satisfaction patterns that are currently invisible.

### Tier 4: Sounder Ecosystem Partnerships (Revenue-sharing / Registry Integration)

These are swine industry partnerships deployed through Sounder, not direct SomeAI contracts. Revenue comes through registry integration fees, breeder subscriptions, and data licensing.

| Partner | Role | Est. Revenue | Model | 2yr Revenue Est. |
|---------|------|-------------|-------|-----------------|
| **NSR** (National Swine Registry) | Multi-breed purebred registry | $3M–$5M | Revenue share: registrations + $50–$100/breeder subscriptions + data licensing + $500–$1K per show | **$120K–$240K** |
| **CPS** (Certified Pedigree Swine) | Largest multi-breed registry | Unknown | MSA drafted, similar model to NSR | **$80K–$160K** |
| **TSA** (Tamworth Swine Association) | Heritage breed registry | Unknown | MSA drafted, smaller scale | **$20K–$40K** |

**Ecosystem thesis:** Sounder becomes the unified pedigree and genetics platform for the US swine industry. No existing system handles crossbred ancestral trees. Each registry partnership extends the graph — and the graph is the moat.

### Pipeline Summary

| Category | Entities | 2yr Contract Value | Annualized |
|----------|----------|--------------------|------------|
| Active (ISG) | 1 | $960,000 + deployment | **$480,000/yr** |
| Tier 1 (Enterprise) | 1 | $510,000 | **$255,000/yr** |
| Tier 2 (Growth) | 2 | $291,000 | **$145,500/yr** |
| Tier 3 (Foundation) | 2 | $198,000 | **$99,000/yr** |
| Tier 4 (Sounder Ecosystem) | 3 | $220K–$440K | **$110K–$220K/yr** |
| **Total Pipeline** | **9** | **$2.18M–$2.40M** | **$1.09M–$1.20M/yr** |

## III. Consumer App Revenue — App Store & Subscriptions

SomeAI builds consumer-facing tools that generate recurring revenue through the App Store and Google Play. These are Charlotte instances tailored for the general public — not managed service, but self-served subscription products.

### Active / In Development

| App | Model | Price Point | TAM Estimate | Year 1 Projection | Year 3 Projection |
|-----|-------|-------------|-------------|-------------------|-------------------|
| **SomeLocks** | One-time IAP | $3.99 (unlock 1,984 levels) | Casual puzzle market: $9.2B | $15K–$60K | $50K–$200K |
| **CardVault Consumer** | Freemium subscription | $4.99/mo or $39.99/yr | Collector tools: $2.1B | $20K–$80K | $100K–$400K |
| **Maestro** | SaaS subscription | $29/mo (free tier exists) | Strategy tools: $4.8B | $10K–$50K | $80K–$300K |
| **BarnOS Mobile** | Subscription + per-farm | $9.99/mo per operation | Ag tech: $22.5B | $5K–$25K | $50K–$200K |

### Consumer Revenue Projection

| Year | Apps Live | Active Users (est.) | Annual Revenue | Notes |
|------|-----------|-------------------|----------------|-------|
| 2026 | 2 (SomeLocks, CardVault) | 500–2,000 | $35K–$140K | Launch year, organic growth |
| 2027 | 4 (+ Maestro, BarnOS) | 3,000–12,000 | $150K–$600K | Cross-promotion, App Store featuring |
| 2028 | 6+ (new games, tools) | 15,000–50,000 | $500K–$2M | Compounding, word of mouth |
| 2029 | 8+ | 50,000–150,000 | $1.5M–$5M | Category presence established |
| 2030 | 10+ | 150,000–400,000 | $4M–$12M | Platform economics kick in |

**Consumer thesis:** Each app is a Charlotte instance with a different skin. The time-to-tool is proportional to the ability to convey what you want. SomeLocks proves SomeAI can ship a revenue-generating indie product in hours. The pipeline of consumer tools is infinite because every domain Charlotte touches can produce a public-facing app.

## IV. Five-Year Revenue Projection

### Assumptions

1. **ISG contract live** Feb 23, 2026 — $480K/yr confirmed
2. **Pipeline conversion rate:** 60% of drafted MSAs convert within 12 months
3. **New client acquisition:** 2–4 new managed service clients per year via referral network (PE, industry associations, word of mouth)
4. **Consumer apps:** conservative organic growth, no paid acquisition
5. **Sounder ecosystem:** generates indirect value (industry access, data, credibility) beyond direct revenue
6. **No VC/PE funding assumed** — projections reflect self-sustaining growth from revenue

### Revenue by Stream

| Year | ISG Contract | Pipeline Clients | New Clients (Acq'd) | Consumer Apps | Sounder Ecosystem | **Total Revenue** |
|------|-------------|-----------------|---------------------|---------------|-------------------|-------------------|
| **2026** | $480K | $0 (signing) | $0 | $35K | $20K | **$535K** |
| **2027** | $480K | $540K | $180K | $150K | $110K | **$1.46M** |
| **2028** | $480K | $720K | $600K | $500K | $200K | **$2.50M** |
| **2029** | $480K* | $720K | $1.2M | $1.5M | $350K | **$4.25M** |
| **2030** | $480K* | $720K* | $2.4M | $4M | $600K | **$8.20M** |

*ISG and early pipeline contracts renew at existing rates; new clients acquired at progressively higher tiers as Charlotte's track record grows.*

### Revenue Composition Shift

| Year | Managed Service % | Consumer Apps % | Ecosystem % |
|------|------------------|----------------|-------------|
| 2026 | 90% | 7% | 3% |
| 2027 | 82% | 10% | 8% |
| 2028 | 72% | 20% | 8% |
| 2029 | 56% | 35% | 9% |
| 2030 | 44% | 49% | 7% |

**Key insight:** Managed service contracts are the beachhead and credibility builder. Consumer apps become the growth engine as each Charlotte instance generates its own subscriber base. By Year 5, consumer revenue approaches parity with managed service — and consumer scales without incremental service delivery cost.

### Gross Margin Trajectory

| Year | Revenue | COGS (Service Delivery) | Gross Profit | Gross Margin |
|------|---------|------------------------|-------------|-------------|
| 2026 | $535K | $280K | $255K | 48% |
| 2027 | $1.46M | $620K | $840K | 58% |
| 2028 | $2.50M | $875K | $1.63M | 65% |
| 2029 | $4.25M | $1.28M | $2.97M | 70% |
| 2030 | $8.20M | $2.05M | $6.15M | 75% |

Margin improves because: (1) consumer revenue is ~95% margin, (2) managed service onboarding costs decline per the substrate leverage effect, and (3) domain vocabulary/protocol templates become reusable across clients in the same vertical.

## V. Valuation Scenarios — Updated

### Pre-Revenue (Current — February 2026)

| Basis | Valuation Range | Rationale |
|-------|----------------|-----------|
| First signed contract ($480K ARR) + 9-entity pipeline | $5M–$15M | Revenue-stage deep tech with proven architecture |
| + PE network access (Richard Enterprises relationships) | $10M–$25M | Distribution is the scarcest asset in enterprise software |
| + Consumer app portfolio (4 products in development) | $15M–$30M | Multiple revenue vectors reduce single-customer risk |

### Series A Target (Late 2026 / Early 2027)

Trigger: ISG deployment proven + 2–3 pipeline conversions + consumer app traction

| Metric | Target | Notes |
|--------|--------|-------|
| ARR at raise | $800K–$1.2M | ISG + 2-3 pipeline clients + consumer |
| Revenue multiple | 20–30x | Category-creating infrastructure premium |
| **Pre-money valuation** | **$16M–$36M** | |
| Raise amount | $3M–$8M | Funds: 3 FTEs + consumer app marketing + 2nd vertical expansion |
| Dilution | 15–25% | Standard Series A |

### Year 3 / Year 5 Projections

| Timeframe | Revenue | Applied Multiple | Valuation Range |
|-----------|---------|-----------------|-----------------|
| Year 3 (2028) | $2.5M | 20–30x (growth-stage infra) | **$50M–$75M** |
| Year 5 (2030) | $8.2M | 25–40x (category creator) | **$205M–$328M** |

These are conservative relative to the VALUATION_MODEL.md projections because they assume self-sustaining growth from revenue without PE cluster deployment. With PE funding and smart village deployment, the VALUATION_MODEL scenarios ($750M–$6B Year 5) remain valid on the high end.

## VI. Client-by-Client Contract Model

### Double Contract Structure

Every managed service client receives two contracts:

**Contract A — Deployment & Migration (Foundation Phase)**
- One-time engagement, 3–6 months
- Charlotte scans the business, builds the graph, seeds the substrate
- Covers: discovery, vocabulary configuration, historical import, graph seeding, protocol calibration, validation
- Price: proportional to business complexity and data maturity

**Contract B — Ongoing Managed Service (Operations Phase)**
- Monthly retainer, 18–24 months with auto-renewal
- Charlotte delivers operational intelligence: signal monitoring, protocol evaluation, drift alerts, analytics, account management
- Price: proportional to value delivered (15–35% of quantified value created)

### Per-Client Economics

| Client | Foundation Revenue | Operations Revenue | 2yr Total | Gross Margin | LTV (5yr est.) |
|--------|-------------------|-------------------|-----------|-------------|----------------|
| ISG | TBD ($150K–$300K) | $480K/yr | $960K–$1.26M | 65% | $2.4M–$3.0M |
| CardVault | $60K | $450K | $510K | 72% | $1.3M |
| Wendt Group | $21K | $135K | $156K | 60% | $390K |
| SC Online Sales | $18K | $117K | $135K | 58% | $338K |
| All State Mfg. | $15K | $90K | $105K | 55% | $263K |
| Top Tier Moving | $12K | $81K | $93K | 52% | $233K |
| NSR (rev share) | — | ~$120K/yr | $240K | 70% | $600K |
| CPS (rev share) | — | ~$80K/yr | $160K | 70% | $400K |
| TSA (rev share) | — | ~$20K/yr | $40K | 70% | $100K |
| **Pipeline Total** | **$126K–$276K** | **$1.57M/yr** | **$2.40M–$2.70M** | **63%** | **$6.0M** |

### Clients NOT in Pipeline (Excluded per strategy)

| Entity | Reason | Role |
|--------|--------|------|
| SomeAI | That's us | Operating entity |
| Richard Enterprises | Parent holding company | Corporate structure |
| Serengeti | PE thesis / campus vision | Long-term infrastructure |
| Sounder | Owned division | Strategic vehicle, not revenue source |
| ISG | Already active contract | Revenue, not pipeline |
| PPP Instruments | Research validation domain | Portfolio intelligence proof-of-concept |
| LineLeap | Historical (Jack was CTO) | Case study, not active client |
| GesDate | Internal R&D | Charlotte agent proof-of-concept |

---

## VII. Risk-Adjusted Scenarios

### Bear Case (40% pipeline conversion, slow consumer)

| Year | Revenue | Clients | Notes |
|------|---------|---------|-------|
| 2026 | $500K | 1 (ISG) | Only ISG converts |
| 2027 | $900K | 3 | 2 pipeline conversions |
| 2028 | $1.4M | 5 | Slow organic growth |
| 2029 | $2.2M | 8 | Consumer apps underperform |
| 2030 | $3.5M | 12 | Still growing, but slower |

### Base Case (60% pipeline conversion, moderate consumer)

*This is the projection in Section IV above.*

| Year | Revenue | Clients | Notes |
|------|---------|---------|-------|
| 2026 | $535K | 1 | ISG + consumer launch |
| 2027 | $1.46M | 4–5 | Pipeline converts + first new clients |
| 2028 | $2.50M | 8–10 | Consumer apps gaining traction |
| 2029 | $4.25M | 13–16 | Revenue diversified |
| 2030 | $8.20M | 20–25 | Consumer approaching parity |

### Bull Case (80% pipeline conversion, consumer breakout, PE funding)

| Year | Revenue | Clients | Notes |
|------|---------|---------|-------|
| 2026 | $600K | 1–2 | ISG + early pipeline conversion |
| 2027 | $2.5M | 6–8 | Most pipeline converts + Series A closed |
| 2028 | $6M | 15–20 | Funded expansion into new verticals |
| 2029 | $15M | 35–50 | Consumer apps featured, viral growth |
| 2030 | $35M | 80–120 | Approaching VALUATION_MODEL.md projections |

## VIII. What This Means for Series A

### The Story

SomeAI is not a startup looking for product-market fit. SomeAI has:

1. **A signed industrial contract** ($480K/yr) going live February 2026
2. **A 9-entity pipeline** with drafted MSAs totaling $2.4M over 24 months
3. **Four consumer products** in development generating App Store revenue
4. **An owned livestock platform** (Sounder) with access to 65,000+ registered breeders
5. **A repeatable onboarding engine** that spins up a complete client package in days, not months
6. **A universal architecture** proven across 5 domains (industrial, livestock, cultural, logistics, consumer)

### The Ask

$3M–$8M at $16M–$36M pre-money. Funds:
- 3 full-time engineers ($450K/yr loaded)
- Consumer app marketing ($200K/yr)
- Second vertical expansion (healthcare or logistics)
- 18 months of runway at current burn

### The Return

At 25x revenue multiple on Year 5 base case ($8.2M):
- **Series A investor gets:** 15–25% of a $205M company = **$31M–$51M**
- **On $5M investment:** **6x–10x return in 5 years**

At bull case ($35M revenue, 30x multiple = $1.05B):
- **Series A investor gets:** 15–25% of $1.05B = **$158M–$263M**
- **On $5M investment:** **32x–53x return in 5 years**
