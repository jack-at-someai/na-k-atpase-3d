# Serengeti Farms — Operations Manual

> *"Show Me Something Different I Have Already Seen"*

## Mission

Rejuvenate and transform impactful but outdated applications, creating multiple revenue streams while fostering cutting-edge solutions.

## Core Philosophy

People are drawn to familiarity because it feels comfortable and proven. But they crave novelty that makes familiar concepts feel fresh and exciting. Serengeti Farms capitalizes on this duality — combining the reliability of what people know with the allure of what's new.

## Four Pillars

### 1. Reinvention, Not Replacement
Preserve the essence of successful ideas. Enhance their value with new features, technologies, and perspectives. Take an app that solved a real problem but now looks dated — update its design, functionality, and relevance.

### 2. Familiar Foundations with Novel Layers
Start with familiar structures for user comfort, then add layers of innovation that surprise and delight. Add gamification, AI-driven insights, or cloud integration to previously static tools.

### 3. Solving Problems in New Ways
Approach existing challenges with modern solutions. Use ML, AR, blockchain, or other cutting-edge tech to reimagine user experiences.

### 4. Design-Centric Innovation
Prioritize sleek, intuitive design. Focus on clean UI/UX that leverages familiarity but removes friction points.

## Investment Tranches

Each tranche produces a **minimum of 3 apps** across multiple income streams.

### Tranche #1 (Active)
- **Units**: 10–12 ownership positions
- **Apps per tranche**: Minimum 3
- **Ownership per investor**: 5% per app developed
- **Staffing**: Internal team + external specialists

## App Lifecycle

```
SCOUT → EVALUATE → SELECT → DESIGN → BUILD → LAUNCH → SCALE → EXIT
```

| Phase | Description | Owner |
|---|---|---|
| Scout | Identify obscure, impactful apps with outdated tech | Prides + Research Team |
| Evaluate | Score against criteria, market size, rebuild cost | Founders |
| Select | Founders vote on top 3 per tranche | SFO |
| Design | Modern UI/UX, feature roadmap, tech stack | Dev Team |
| Build | Agile sprints, MVP → beta → production | Dev Team + External |
| Launch | Go-to-market, user acquisition, PR | Marketing |
| Scale | Growth loops, partnerships, upsells | Ops |
| Exit | Acquisition, licensing, or long-term hold | Founders |

## The Charlotte Advantage

Every Farms app is built on the **Charlotte substrate** rather than from scratch. This is the key differentiator from any other incubator:

| Without Charlotte | With Charlotte |
|---|---|
| 6+ months per app, $200K+ | 2–3 months per app, $50K–$80K |
| Bespoke backend per product | Shared graph infrastructure |
| No cross-portfolio intelligence | Signals from one app inform all others |
| Linear cost scaling | Amortized — each new app is cheaper |
| Dev team must learn new domain | Domain = new node types + protocols |

### How It Works
1. **Define the domain**: What are the nodes? (sows, venues, compressors)
2. **Define the signals**: What do we observe? (weight, capacity, maintenance events)
3. **Define the protocols**: What's expected? (heat check every 21 days, reorder at threshold)
4. **Build the UI**: Flutter mobile + Next.js web dashboard on top of Charlotte APIs
5. **Deploy**: Charlotte handles persistence, time-indexing, relationships, and alerts

### Proof of Concept
Charlotte is already live at two scales:
- **Sounder** (swine): 1,174 nodes, 10,045 signals, 1,919 edges — Trogdon Showpigs test deployment
- **ServiceIQ** (industrial): Phase 1 deployed across ISG's 16+ brands and 80,000 employees

## Current Portfolio

See `portfolio/` for detailed company profiles:
- `SOUNDER_ENTERPRISES.md` — Show pig herd management ($5–10M)
- `NIGHTLIFE_APP.md` — Bar passes and venue management ($110M)
- `INDUSTRIAL_SERVICE_GROUP.md` — ServiceIQ predictive distribution ($1B+)

## Pipeline

See `pipeline/` for scouting tracker and evaluation scorecards:
- `APP_SCOUTING_TRACKER.md` — Active pipeline with weighted scoring
- `EVALUATION_SCORECARD.md` — Fill-in template for any candidate app

## Dev Toolchain
