## Concept

A modern platform for nightlife registration, bar passes, and venue access management. The original app had proven utility but ran on outdated technology with poor UX.

### Reinvention Opportunity

- Universal "bar pass" system across partner venues
- Event discovery and reservation
- Age verification and compliance
- VIP/loyalty programs
- Real-time venue capacity and wait times
