# Industrial Service Group (ISG) / ServiceIQ — Portfolio Profile

## Overview

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| **Entity** | Industrial Service Group (under Richard Enterprises) |
| **Product** | ServiceIQ — Charlotte-powered predictive distribution platform |
| **Employees** | 80,000+ (16+ portfolio brands, ~40 at holding company) |
| **Projected Valuation** | $1 Billion+ |
| **Status** | Existing business — Charlotte integration in deployment |
| **Connection to Serengeti** | Referenced in Farms pipeline; ISG is the operational proof that Richard Enterprises operates at scale |

## What Is ISG?

The Industrial Service Group is Jim Richard's existing portfolio of 16+ industrial brands spanning service, distribution, and field operations. This is not a startup — it's a **proven, operating business** with 80,000+ employees generating real revenue.

ISG is relevant to Serengeti because:
1. It proves the Richard Enterprises team can operate at massive scale
2. ServiceIQ (its Charlotte-powered upgrade) validates the Charlotte substrate commercially
3. The "Industrial Service & Distribution" app in Farms #1 pipeline may be a ServiceIQ derivative or adjacent product

## ServiceIQ: Charlotte Meets Industrial Operations

ServiceIQ is the **commercial deployment of Charlotte** at ISG. It transforms industrial distribution from reactive to predictive.

### Charlotte Mapping

| Charlotte Primitive | ISG Application |
|---|---|
| **Node** | Compressors, technicians, customer sites, warehouses, parts |
| **Signal** | Maintenance events, part orders, performance readings, transactions |
| **Edge** | SERVICED_BY (technician → site), SUPPLIES (warehouse → part), INSTALLED_AT (compressor → site) |
| **Protocol** | Preventive maintenance schedules, reorder thresholds, seasonal demand patterns |
| **Metric** | Time-to-repair, reorder accuracy, customer retention, revenue per site |

### Implementation Phases

**Phase 1: Foundation (Year 1 — $500K–$700K investment)**
- Compressor taxonomy standardization across 16+ brands
- Transaction data centralization
- Inventory unification
- Charlotte node/signal model deployed

**Phase 2: Intelligence (Year 2 — $600K–$800K investment)**
- Real-time reasoning engine
- Live pattern detection
- Predictive distribution (anticipate reorders before customers call)

### Success Metrics

| Metric | Target |
|---|---|
| Predictive reorder accuracy | 70%+ |
| Competitor timing accuracy | 60%+ |
| YOY sales growth | 15%+ |
| Inventory waste reduction | 20%+ |
| Technician dispatch efficiency | 30%+ improvement |

## Market Context

Industrial distribution in the U.S. is a **$6+ trillion industry** with extremely fragmented technology adoption. Most distributors run on ERP systems from the 1990s, manual reorder processes, and paper-based field operations.

ServiceIQ, powered by Charlotte, brings:
- **Predictive intelligence** to a sector that's still mostly reactive
- **Unified data** across brands that traditionally operate as siloed P&Ls
- **Real-time signals** from field operations flowing into graph-based analytics

## Why ISG Matters for Serengeti

ISG is the **proof of concept** that Charlotte works at commercial scale. If Charlotte can manage 80,000 employees across 16 brands with predictive distribution, it can manage:
- Show pig breeding operations (Sounder)
- Nightlife venue networks
- Luxury real estate portfolios (Oasis)
- Any future Farms vertical

ISG de-risks the entire Serengeti thesis. It's not "will Charlotte work?" — it's "where else does Charlotte work?"
