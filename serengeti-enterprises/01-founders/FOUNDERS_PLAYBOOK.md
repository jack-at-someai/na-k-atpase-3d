# Serengeti Founders Organization (SFO) — Playbook

> *"Your attitude determines whether you lead or follow; be a lion."*

## What Is SFO?

The Serengeti Founders Organization is the exclusive governing body of Serengeti Enterprises. Membership is **invitation-only**, capped at **12 Founders**. These are the lions — the individuals whose capital, wisdom, and networks power the entire ecosystem.

Think of SFO as the board of directors for a Wayne Enterprises-tier operation — except every board member is also an investor, mentor, and active participant. Jim Richard's network (Carlyle, KKR, BlackRock, Edgewater, JZ Partners) represents the caliber of relationships that feed the Founder pipeline.

## Founder Profile

The ideal Serengeti Founder is:
- A proven executive, entrepreneur, or investor
- Committed to cross-generational mentorship
- Willing to actively participate (not passive capital)

- 2% bonus ownership in Sounder Enterprises, LLC
- Vote on Farms project selection and strategy
