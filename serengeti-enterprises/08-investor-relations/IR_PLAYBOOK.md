## Investor FAQ

### Q: What is the minimum investment?
$150,000 lump sum or $168,000 over 24 months ($7,000/month).

### Q: What do I own?
5% equity in each of the two apps developed in Farms Tranche #1, plus 2% in Sounder Enterprises, LLC.

### Q: Is there an annual fee?
$9,600/year for Serengeti Enterprises administration (waived for year one).

### Q: How many investors are you accepting?
10–12 for Farms #1.

### Q: When will I see returns?
Returns are tied to portfolio company revenue and exit events. Target first revenue within 12 months of app launch.

### Q: What is the exit strategy?
Portfolio companies can be sold (M&A), licensed, or held for long-term revenue. Serengeti does not force exits — each company is evaluated individually.

### Q: Am I also a Founder?
Not automatically. Founders Organization is by invitation only (max 12 seats). Farms #1 investment gives you priority consideration.

### Q: How involved do I need to be?
As involved as you want. At minimum, you'll receive monthly updates. Founders are expected to attend the annual meeting and mentor Pride members.

### Q: What is Charlotte and why does it matter?
Charlotte is a proprietary graph-native knowledge infrastructure built by Jack Richard (Northwestern MSAI). It provides the shared data substrate for every Farms portfolio app. Instead of building bespoke backends for each app, we deploy new verticals on Charlotte in 2–3 months instead of 6+. It's already live with Sounder (1,174 nodes, 10K+ signals) and deployed at ISG (80K employees, 16+ brands).

### Q: What is the relationship between Serengeti and ISG?
ISG (Industrial Service Group) is a sister holding under Richard Enterprises with 80,000+ employees and 16+ brands. ServiceIQ, ISG's Charlotte-powered predictive distribution system, validates the Charlotte substrate at commercial scale. The $1B valuation in the Farms pipeline references an ISG-adjacent opportunity. They are separate entities with arm's-length transactions.

### Q: Who built this?
The Richard family. Jim Richard (Chairman/CEO) — decades of PE and industrial operations. Jack Richard — AI infrastructure (Charlotte, SomeAI Research Lab, 37 research projects). Joseph Richard — operations and engineering management. Advised by Kris Hammond (Northwestern MSAI Director, co-founder of Narrative Science).
