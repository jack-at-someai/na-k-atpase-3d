|---|---|---|
| Pig Breeder | Ancestor to Sounder — breeding genetics simulator | Farms (Sounder) |
| Show Animal Tree | Skill tree for livestock genetics | Farms (Sounder) |
| Substrate | Charlotte knowledge graph explorer | All (Charlotte core) |
| Kanri-Kanri | Toolkit for operational management | Command Center |
| Swarm Intelligence | Multi-agent emergence | Singularity (distributed systems) |
| Neural Networks | Pattern recognition fundamentals | Singularity (AI deal sourcing) |
| Chaos Theory | Nonlinear dynamics | Singularity (portfolio prediction) |
| Signal Processing | Time series, drift detection | Charlotte core (signal engine) |
| Temporal Databases | Event sourcing, bitemporal | Charlotte core (append-only model) |

### Biomimicry R&D as Singularity Fuel

|---|---|
| Bio-architecture | How nature organizes structure → protocol design patterns |
| Bio-locomotion | Scaling laws → signal normalization across domains |
| Biomimetic materials | Material lifecycle → node lifecycle modeling |
| Ecological systems | Ecosystem dynamics → flywheel system modeling |
| Nature-inspired algorithms | Evolutionary optimization → portfolio allocation |

## Research Methodology

### For Market Research
1. Pull industry reports (IBISWorld, Statista, PitchBook)
2. Interview 3–5 practitioners in the target market
3. Analyze top 5 competitors (features, pricing, funding, reviews)
4. Size the TAM/SAM/SOM
5. Document in division-specific folder

### For Competitive Research
1. Map all direct and indirect competitors
2. Score on: features, pricing, market share, funding, team
3. Identify white space and differentiation opportunities
4. Update quarterly

### For Legal Research
1. Engage securities counsel for fundraising structure
2. Engage corporate counsel for entity formation
3. Document all decisions in `07-legal-corporate/`
4. Review annually or when raising new capital

### For Charlotte/Technical Research
1. Check SomeAI instruments for prior art or applicable models
2. Review Charlotte docs (`charlotte/docs/`) for substrate capabilities
3. Consult academic lineage (Hammond, Forbus, Ferrucci) for theoretical grounding
4. Document findings in `06-singularity/` or relevant division folder
