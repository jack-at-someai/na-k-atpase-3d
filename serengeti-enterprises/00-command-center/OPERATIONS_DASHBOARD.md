## Risk Register

| Risk | Severity | Mitigation | Owner |
|---|---|---|---|
| Founder recruitment stalls below 6 | HIGH | Expand warm intro network via Jim's PE contacts (Carlyle, KKR, BlackRock network); adjust minimum commitment terms | Jim |
| App development timeline overrun | HIGH | Charlotte substrate reduces build time 40-60%; modular MVP approach; external dev partners on standby | Jack |
| Charlotte substrate risk (single point of failure) | MEDIUM | Maintain fallback to conventional stack; document Charlotte-to-Postgres migration path | Jack |
| Pride member retention drops | MEDIUM | Monthly engagement tracking via Charlotte signals; mentor check-ins; Hot Seat rotation | Prides Lead |
| Oasis fund legal complexity | MEDIUM | Engage fund counsel early; mirror proven Pacaso/Ember structures; Jim's PE legal network | Jim |
| ISG-Serengeti conflict of interest | LOW | Clean entity separation; independent operating agreements; arm's-length transactions | Legal |
| Key-person risk (Jack/Charlotte) | MEDIUM | Document Charlotte architecture; train second engineer; open-source substrate layer if needed | Jack |
