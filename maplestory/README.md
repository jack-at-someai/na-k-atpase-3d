# MapleStory Virtual Bazaar

A virtual fresh market and bazaar inspired by the channel-based merchant system in MapleStory.

## Concept

In MapleStory, players can set up **Hired Merchants** — automated shop agents that stay in-game and sell your wares (up to 8 item slots) even while you're offline. Multiple merchants populate shared channels, creating a bustling player-driven marketplace you can browse stall by stall.

This project takes that system and re-skins it as a **sushi contractor and fisherman's market**. Instead of fantasy loot, the stalls are filled with fresh catches, prepared sushi, and market goods. The view is a **vertical 2D side-scrolling fish market** — think pixel-art market lanes where each vendor stall is clickable.

## How It Works

- **Channels** — Just like MapleStory's channel system, the bazaar is split into channels. Each channel is a row or lane of the market with its own set of vendor stalls.
- **Merchant Stalls** — Each stall is an automated agent (mirroring the Hired Merchant). A vendor can list up to **8 items** for sale, displayed in a compact shop UI.
- **Shop UI** — Clicking on any stall opens a shop panel styled after the classic MapleStory merchant interface: an item grid, prices, quantities, and a clean pixel-aesthetic frame.
- **Vertical 2D View** — The market is rendered as a vertical 2D scene. Stalls are stacked and tiled so you scroll through the bazaar like walking through a real fish market alley.

## Ultimate Goal

**Virtually represent a fresh market or bazaar.**

The end vision is a living, browsable digital marketplace that captures the feel of walking through a real-world fish market or open-air bazaar — vendors calling out their catches, stalls packed with goods, and the energy of a crowded market lane — all rendered in a 2D pixel-art style with the familiar UI patterns that made MapleStory's merchant system so satisfying to use.

## Planned Features

- Channel selection and navigation
- Animated vertical 2D market scene with vendor stalls
- Clickable stalls that open a MapleStory-style shop UI (8-slot item grid)
- Vendor/merchant agent setup — list items, set prices, let the stall run
- Sushi and fresh fish theming — item art, stall decorations, market ambiance
- Multiple market lanes (channels) to browse

## Tech Stack

TBD — to be determined as the project takes shape.
