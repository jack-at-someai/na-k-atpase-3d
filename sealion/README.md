# Sea Lion

Ocean science research division. Everything we do to pursue scuba diving research lives here.

Sea Lion is one of six business research segments — the one focused on the ocean. The founder is a rescue diver building toward opening a dive shop, and this brand will be the umbrella for all ocean science operations: dive training, marine research, equipment, reef monitoring, underwater survey work, and anything else that touches the water.

## Brand

The logo is a lion wearing a dive mask and snorkel — a literal sea lion. Primary palette is deep navy, ocean blue, and golden amber.

## Scope

Sea Lion covers the **ocean science** vertical of the broader research business. The six segments are:

| Segment | Domain |
|---|---|
| **Agriculture** | Livestock, breeding, land management |
| **Sports Science** | Human performance, training, biomechanics |
| **Ocean Science** | Scuba diving research, marine biology, reef systems |
| TBD | — |
| TBD | — |
| TBD | — |

Ocean science is founder-led. The other segments are delegated to their respective teams.

## Roadmap

- Consolidate all dive research and branding assets
- Dive shop business plan and location scouting
- Training program development (rescue diver pathway and beyond)
- Marine research partnerships and survey methodology
- Equipment evaluation and gear reviews
- Reef monitoring and underwater data collection frameworks

## Reference Hubs

| Hub | Path | Description |
|---|---|---|
| **Ocean Science** | [`ocean-science/`](ocean-science/index.html) | Comprehensive reference hub covering dive physiology, next-gen dive tech, underwater swarm robotics, ocean biomimicry, marine observation, coral science, underwater AI, freediving science, and open datasets. Charlotte memory pre-load for the ocean science vertical. |
