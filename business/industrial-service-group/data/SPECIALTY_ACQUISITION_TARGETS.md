# ISG Specialty Vertical — Acquisition Target Research

**Prepared:** February 18, 2026
**For:** Jim Richard (CEO, ISG) / TJC LP (PE Sponsor)
**Vertical:** Specialty — Turbomachinery Repair, Industrial Maintenance/Millwright, Mechanical Contractors, Hydraulic Repair
**Context:** Expands the Specialty section of the Acquisition Mesh Gradient with deep research on independent targets

---

## ISG SPECIALTY VERTICAL TODAY

ISG currently holds 5 brands in the Specialty vertical:

| Brand | Location | Specialty |
|-------|----------|-----------|
| **Turbomachinery Industries** | Corpus Christi, TX | Turbo repair — steam/gas turbines, compressors |
| **Compressor & Turbine Services (CTS)** | Houston, TX | Rotating equipment repair |
| **Dynamic Mechanical Solutions (DMS)** | AR | Mechanical services |
| **CORE Industrial Maintenance** | Mount Vernon, AL | Industrial maintenance — steel/aluminum mills |
| **National Mill Maintenance** | Birmingham, AL | Mill maintenance — steel industry |

**Key competitors in turbomachinery:**
- **EthosEnergy** (One Equity Partners, acquired Dec 2024 for $138M) — 3,600 employees, 23 global sites
- **RMS / Rotating Machinery Services** (Arcline Investment, $9.1B AUM) — acquired TurboCare steam turbine/compressor business from EthosEnergy
- **Fox Innovation & Technologies** (Bluewater PE) — acquired Revak Keene (Jul 2023), S.T. Cotter Turbine (Aug 2024), Sirio Solutions (2025). Now $100M+ LTM revenue. Aggressive roll-up.
- **Power Services Group / PSG** (Center Rock Capital) — turbine generator maintenance. Previously Azalea Capital portfolio.

**The turbo aftermarket space is consolidating fast.** Fox Innovation alone has done 3 acquisitions in 18 months. The pool of independent turbo shops is shrinking. ISG must move now.

| **Founded** | 1981 (under Allis-Chalmers); independently owned since Dec 2001 |
| **Owner** | Clayton Lau (purchased from Allis-Chalmers bankruptcy trustee in 2001) |
| **PE Status** | **NOT PE-owned.** Owner-operated for 23 years. |
| **Revenue** | $10M-$22M (varies by source: RocketReach $21.7M, D&B $6.25M, LeadIQ $10M) |
| **Employees** | 42-51 (SBA PPP retained 42 jobs) |
| **Specialties** | Centrifugal compressors, axial compressors, reciprocating compressors, screw compressors, steam turbines, gas turbines, hydro-turbines. Non-OEM critical rotating equipment repair. |

## PRIORITY ACQUISITION SCENARIOS

### Scenario A: Texas Turbomachinery Platform (2-3 acquisitions, $15-30M combined revenue)

**Targets:** Houston Dynamic Services (T1) + Blade Runner Turbo (T2) + optionally Compressor & Turbine Services (T5)

**Result:** ISG becomes the dominant independent turbo aftermarket provider on the Gulf Coast. Houston Dynamic's shop capability + BRTS field service + existing Turbomachinery Industries (Corpus Christi) + CTS (Houston) = full geographic and capability coverage.

**Estimated cost:** $5-15M total (6-10x EBITDA)

**Charlotte integration:** Day 1 — ingest HDS customer data, equipment records, service history. Protocol 2 (reactivation) fires on dormant turbo customers. Cross-sell compressor parts via ISG's existing IAP/IAC/Pinnacle brands.

### Scenario B: Southeast Millwright Expansion (2-3 acquisitions, $15-35M combined revenue)

**Targets:** Midsouth Mechanical (MW3) + International Welding & Fabrication (MC1) + Industrial Maintenance Company (MW8)

**Result:** ISG millwright/mechanical coverage extends from Alabama through Georgia, South Carolina, Tennessee, Mississippi, Louisiana, and Florida. Direct complement to CORE Industrial (Mount Vernon, AL) and National Mill (Birmingham, AL).

**Estimated cost:** $5-15M total

**Charlotte integration:** Merge millwright/mechanical client databases with ISG's existing mill maintenance customer base. Identify cross-sell opportunities (turbo services, compressor/motor repair) for Midsouth's automotive and paper mill clients.

### Scenario C: Midwest Industrial Platform (3-4 acquisitions, $30-60M combined revenue)

**Targets:** Icon Industrial Services (MW1) + Wooster Hydrostatics (H1) + Appalachian Mechanical (MW5) + DNC Hydraulics (H2)

**Result:** ISG establishes a Midwest industrial services cluster covering IA, OH, WV, KY, IN. Millwright + hydraulic repair capability. Combined ~$52M revenue from 4 independent companies.

**Estimated cost:** $15-35M total

**Charlotte integration:** Ohio River Valley and Midwest industrial customers get access to ISG's full portfolio. Hydraulic repair (Wooster + DNC) pairs naturally with mill maintenance (CORE + National Mill).

### Scenario D: Full Specialty Vertical Buildout (6-8 acquisitions, $70-130M combined revenue)

**Targets:** HDS (T1) + Icon (MW1) + Midsouth (MW3) + Wooster Hydrostatics (H1) + DNC Hydraulics (H2) + North American Millwright (MW4) + IWF (MC1) + Tri-State Hydraulics (H7)

**Result:** ISG Specialty vertical goes from 5 brands in 3 states to 13 brands in 12+ states. Full turbo, millwright, mechanical, and hydraulic capability across Gulf Coast, Southeast, Midwest, and Mid-Atlantic.

**Estimated total capital:** $25-60M

## COMPETITIVE URGENCY — THE ROLL-UP IS HAPPENING NOW

| Roll-Up Platform | PE Sponsor | Recent Acquisitions | ISG Impact |
|-----------------|-----------|-------------------|------------|
| **Fox Innovation** | Bluewater PE | Revak Keene (Jul 2023), S.T. Cotter (Aug 2024), Sirio (2025) | 3 turbo acquisitions in 18 months. $100M+ LTM revenue. Houston shop. |
| **MCE / Frontenac** | Frontenac | Nova Hydraulics (Jan 2025), 24 total since 2020 | Now in hydraulics. Could approach Wooster Hydrostatics or DNC next. |
| **RMS / Arcline** | Arcline Investment | TurboCare (from EthosEnergy) | Premium turbo aftermarket. 9 facilities. |
| **EthosEnergy / OEP** | One Equity Partners | Completed Dec 2024 ($138M) | Major OEM-adjacent turbo platform. |
| **PSG / Center Rock** | Center Rock Capital | Power Plant Services, TGM, Airco, Turbine Resources | Turbine generator maintenance across US. |

**Every month ISG waits, the pool of independent targets shrinks.** Fox Innovation is actively shopping in Houston. MCE/Frontenac has entered the hydraulic space. The independent turbo shops, millwright contractors, and hydraulic repair businesses on this list will not remain independent indefinitely.
