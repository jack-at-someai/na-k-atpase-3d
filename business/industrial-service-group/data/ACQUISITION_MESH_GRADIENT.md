Acquired ABB Industrial Services (Aug 2024), Demaria Electric (Feb 2025), TechPro Power Group (Dec 2025). Rolling up the entire US motor repair industry. Every independent motor shop ISG doesn't buy, IPS will.

### MCE / Frontenac (Motors) — 13 Acquisitions Since Jan 2023

Acquired Romanoff Industries in Toledo, OH — ISG's Ohio territory. EBITDA grown 15x. Actively competing for the same independents.

### DXP Enterprises (Pumps) — Public, Aggressive

15 acquisitions under "DXP Water" initiative. Largest distributor of rotating equipment in North America. Moores Pump (LA), Pump Solutions ($36.8M), Triangle Pump — all in ISG-adjacent territory.

---

## VERTICAL 1: COMPRESSORS

Charlotte proves out here first. The Feb 24 launch demonstrates the substrate on IAP + IAC. Every compressor acquisition after that plugs directly into a proven system.

### Tier 1 — Acquire Now (Present to TJC in Tampa)

| # | Target | Location | Size | Why | Est. Revenue | Effort |
|---|--------|----------|------|-----|-------------|--------|
| **C1** | **Blake & Pendleton** | 14 branches, 8 SE states (AL, FL, GA, MS, TN, NC, SC, AR) | 220+ employees | Fills entire Southeast. PE-familiar (Svoboda → Five Points). Single largest available add-on in compressed air. Sullair authorization. | $50-80M | HIGH — multi-state, PE negotiation |

| **C3** | **Brehob Corporation** | Indianapolis IN + 6 cities (IN, OH, KY, MI) | 7 locations, family-owned since 1953 | Multi-state Midwest. Adds facility maintenance beyond compressors. Deepens IN/OH/KY. | $15-30M | MEDIUM — succession play |

### Tier 2 — Acquire Q3-Q4 2026

| # | Target | Location | Size | Why | Est. Revenue | Effort |
|---|--------|----------|------|-----|-------------|--------|
| **C4** | **Compressed Air Systems Inc.** | Orlando + Tampa FL | 60+ years | Kaeser distributor. Fills FL coverage gap (ISG only has Cape Coral). | $10-20M | LOW-MEDIUM |
| **C5** | **Industrial Supply & Service (Pneu-Power)** | North LA, AR, East TX | 3 service centers, founded 1950s | Fills Louisiana gap. Strengthens AR/East TX. | $8-15M | LOW |
| **C6** | **3C Industrial** | Texas (multiple locations) | Regional | Strengthens TX footprint alongside IAP and ASE. | $10-25M | MEDIUM |
| **C7** | **Pattons** | 6+ locations: NC, SC, GA, VA, AL | 75+ years | Authorized ELGi distributor. Fills GA/Carolinas gap. | $15-25M | MEDIUM |

## VERTICAL 2: VALVES

ISG currently has Industrial Valve Service (AL/LA/TN), Tri-State Valve (TN/AR/KY/IN/MS/MO/TX), Georgia Western (GA — valve actuators), Morin Process Equipment (AL), and Dynamic Mechanical Solutions (AL — valve distribution). Strong Southeast presence. Major gap in Midwest and Northeast.

### Tier 1 — Acquire Now

| # | Target | Location | Size | Why | Est. Revenue | Effort |
|---|--------|----------|------|-----|-------------|--------|
| **V1** | **Southern Valve Services** | Deer Park TX (Houston) | 38,000 sq ft shop, 2 Gulf Coast locations | Severe service valve repair. Houston petrochemical corridor. Complements Industrial Valve Service. | $10-20M | LOW-MEDIUM |
| **V2** | **Independence Valve & Supply** | Houston TX + Orange TX | Regional | Gulf Coast valve distribution. Covers Beaumont/Port Arthur petrochem corridor. | $8-15M | LOW |
| **V3** | **Precision Pump & Valve Service** | Charleston WV, Louisville KY + Ohio Valley | Family-owned since 1956 | Ohio Valley coverage. Complements Tri-State Valve. Cross-vertical (pumps + valves). | $8-15M | LOW — succession |

### Tier 2 — Acquire Q3-Q4 2026

| # | Target | Location | Size | Why | Est. Revenue | Effort |
|---|--------|----------|------|-----|-------------|--------|
| **V4** | **Gulf Coast Oil & Gas Industries (GCI)** | Houston TX | Founded 1946 (80 years) | Valve manufacture + remanufacture + instrumentation. Adds manufacturing capability. | $10-20M | MEDIUM |
| **V5** | **Coastal Valve & Equipment** | South TX | Regional | Fills South TX valve gap alongside Corpus Christi presence. | $5-12M | LOW |

### Competitive Threat

**SunSource (Clayton Dubilier & Rice)** acquired Vytl Controls Group (Jan 2026) — 1,100 employees, valve automation + remanufacturing. This is the PE platform ISG competes against in valves. ISG needs scale to compete.

---

## VERTICAL 3: PUMPS

ISG currently has Renewal Service Inc. (IL/AL) as its sole dedicated pump brand. Morin Process Equipment carries pump lines but is classified under Process Equipment. Minimal pump coverage. This vertical has the most room to grow. Note: Georgia Western was previously listed here but is a valve actuator specialist, now correctly classified under Valves & Actuators.

### Tier 1 — Acquire Now

| # | Target | Location | Size | Why | Est. Revenue | Effort |
|---|--------|----------|------|-----|-------------|--------|
| **P1** | **Fischer Process Industries** | OH, IN, KY, PA, WV (57+ years) | Multi-state, multi-location | Perfect ISG Midwest overlap. Carries pumps AND valves. Flowserve authorization. | $25-50M | MEDIUM-HIGH |
| **P2** | **Straeffer Pump & Supply** | IN, Southern IL, TN, KY | Full-line pump distributor | Exact ISG territory. Adds municipal/wastewater vertical. | $10-20M | LOW-MEDIUM |

### Tier 2 — Acquire Q3-Q4 2026

| **P3** | **PumpWorks** | TX, LA, OK | 24/7 centrifugal pump repair | Adds pump repair capability across Gulf Coast. Emergency service model. | $8-15M | LOW |
| **P4** | **ABET Distributing USA** | Houston TX area | Regional | Houston pump distribution. Complements TX presence. | $5-10M | LOW |

### Competitive Threat

**DXP Enterprises (DXPE)** — public company, 15 water/wastewater pump acquisitions. Largest NA rotating equipment distributor. Moving aggressively in TX and LA.
**Tencarva (Bessemer)** — 35 locations, Southeast + Midwest. Acquired Hoffman-Kane (PA/OH/WV) in Feb 2026. Directly overlapping ISG territory.

---

## VERTICAL 4: MOTORS

ISG has Soles Electric (Fairmont, WV) and Illinois Electric Works (Granite City, IL). Two brands, two states — both corrected from earlier misidentification of Soles as TX-based. Motor repair is consolidating faster than any other ISG vertical — IPS has 115+ locations (34 acquisitions since 2019) and MCE has done 24 acquisitions since 2020 under Frontenac.

**Updated February 18, 2026.** The EASA mapping exercise is now complete. Below are 28 named independent motor repair targets across ISG's territory, verified not PE-owned as of this date.

### Key Competitive Intelligence (Updated)

| Platform | PE Sponsor | Pace | Locations | ISG Overlap |
|----------|-----------|------|-----------|-------------|
| **IPS** | Searchlight Capital | 34 acquisitions since 2019, ~6-8/year | 115+ (US, Canada, UK, Caribbean) | Nationwide — every state ISG operates in. ABB Industrial Services in Evansville IN. Midwest Switchgear in Hamilton OH. Tampa Armature Works in FL. Evans Enterprises in TX/AR/OK. |
| **MCE** | Frontenac | 24 acquisitions since 2020, 16 in 2023-24 alone | 62 facilities, 18 states | OH (Romanoff/Toledo), AL (General Machinery/Birmingham), IN (Nova Hydraulics), GA/SE (Applied Industrial Controls). EBITDA grown 15x. |

| Industrial Electrical Company (IEC) | Modesto, CA | Egan Company | Apr 2020 | Founded 1935, ~$43M rev, 200 employees |

### Priority Geographies for Motor Shop Acquisitions

| Market | Why | Urgency |
|--------|-----|---------|
| Houston TX | Largest industrial market in ISG territory. Soles Electric is in Fairmont WV — no ISG motor brand in Houston. Multiple independents available. | CRITICAL |
| Michigan | Major manufacturing state. HECO ($34M, Kalamazoo) is actively acquiring competitors — will become a regional platform. York Repair (Bay City) still available. | HIGH |
| Midwest (KS, MO, WI, MN, IA) | Independent Electric (IEMCO) is the dominant independent at $10-40M with 6 locations. L&S Electric ($44-70M, 13 locations) is the largest independent in upper Midwest. Both are succession-ready family businesses. | HIGH |
| Southeast (AL, TN, GA, NC, SC) | Jay Industrial ($46-48M, Birmingham) is the largest remaining independent in the Southeast. Multiple smaller shops available in Knoxville, Atlanta area. | HIGH |
| Pennsylvania / Tri-State | United Industrial Group (Washington PA) and North End Electric (Scranton) serve ISG's WV/OH corridor. Both are EASA accredited. | MEDIUM |
| Oklahoma / Texas West | Brandon & Clark ($54M, Lubbock TX) covers the Southwest. All State Electric (OKC) and Capitol Electric (OKC) are smaller targets. | MEDIUM |
| Louisiana | Industrial Electric Motor Service (Baton Rouge, $12M, 60 employees) serves petrochemical corridor. No ISG motor presence in LA. | MEDIUM |

### MOTOR ACQUISITION TARGETS — Tier 1 (Acquire Now, Present to TJC)

These are the highest-priority independent motor shops. Each is verified NOT PE-owned, EASA-member or accredited, and in ISG territory.

| # | Target | City, State | Est. Revenue | Est. Employees | EASA | Founded | Ownership | Why ISG Should Buy | Urgency |
|---|--------|-------------|-------------|----------------|------|---------|-----------|-------------------|---------|

### MOTOR VERTICAL — Aggregate Acquisition Scenarios

**Scenario A: Southeast Motor Platform (3 acquisitions, $65-75M combined revenue)**
- Jay Industrial (M1) + Electrical Repair Service (M10) + Electric Motor Shop of Wake Forest (M11)
- Result: Birmingham AL anchor + NC coverage. 8-10 locations. Blocks IPS from owning SE motor market.
- Estimated cost: $20-40M (8-12x EBITDA on combined $6-10M EBITDA)

**Scenario B: Midwest Motor Platform (3 acquisitions, $75-130M combined revenue)**
- HECO (M4) + L&S Electric (M5) + EMS Industrial (M7)
- Result: MI, WI, MN coverage. 20+ locations. Becomes 2nd largest motor repair network in Midwest.
- Estimated cost: $30-65M
- **Warning:** HECO is actively acquiring. Delay risks HECO becoming a PE target itself.

**Scenario C: National Motor Network (6 acquisitions, $160-225M combined revenue)**
- Jay Industrial (M1) + HECO (M4) + L&S Electric (M5) + IEMCO (M6) + Brandon & Clark (M2) + North End Electric (M9)
- Result: AL, GA, FL, OK + MI + WI, MN + KS, MO + TX Southwest + PA, NY, NJ
- ISG motor brands go from 2 locations to 30+ locations across 15+ states
- Estimated cost: $60-120M
- **This is the "IPS killer" scenario.** ISG becomes the #2 or #3 motor repair platform in the US overnight.

## THE ACQUISITION MESH GRADIENT — Timing

### Wave 1: Compressor Proof (Feb-Apr 2026)

**Feb 24 — ISG Launch Meeting**
- Charlotte goes live on IAP + IAC (compressor vertical)
- Demonstrate substrate on existing data
- Show competitive pricing intelligence on top 100 SKUs
- Show customer reactivation engine on dormant IAP/IAC customers

**Mar/Apr — TJC Meeting (Tampa)**
- Present Charlotte results from first 30-60 days
- Present this acquisition target list
- **Key message to TJC:** "Charlotte reduces post-acquisition integration from 6-12 months to 90 days. Every target we buy gets its dormant customers reactivated immediately. The faster we acquire, the faster Charlotte compounds the value."
- Request accelerated acquisition capital: 4-6 add-ons per year vs. historical ~2

### Wave 2: Southeast Compressor Expansion (Q2-Q3 2026)

**Primary target: Blake & Pendleton (C1)**
- 14 branches, 8 SE states, 220+ employees
- PE-familiar management (Svoboda → Five Points)
- This is the anchor acquisition that makes ISG the dominant SE compressed air platform
- Charlotte ingests Blake & Pendleton's customer data → reactivation engine fires → immediate ROI

**Secondary: John Bouchard & Sons (C2)**
- Fills TN/KY before OTC or Atlas Copco moves
- 124-year family business — approach succession conversation now

### Wave 3: Cross-Vertical Expansion (Q3-Q4 2026)

**Pumps: Straeffer (P2) + regional pump targets**
- Charlotte already proven on compressors → extend substrate to pump vertical
- Fischer Process (P1) was acquired by Tencarva in Aug 2022 — OFF THE BOARD
- Straeffer covers IN/IL/TN/KY with full-line pump distribution

**Valves: Southern Valve (V1) + Independence Valve (V2)**
- Both Houston. Low effort. Deepens TX presence in valves.

**Motors: EASA mapping COMPLETE — 28 named targets identified (see Vertical 4)**
- Tier 1: Jay Industrial ($46-48M, AL/GA/FL/OK), Brandon & Clark ($54M, TX Southwest), Southwest Electric ($44.5M, OK), HECO ($34M, MI), L&S Electric ($44-70M, WI/MN), IEMCO ($10-41M, KS/MO)
- Tier 2: EMS Industrial ($20M, WI/IA), Dreisilker ($21M, IL/GA), North End Electric ($14M, PA), Electrical Repair Service ($7-12M, AL), Electric Motor Shop ($11M, NC), Tekwell ($3M, TN/GA), York Repair ($10-17M, MI), IEMS ($11-12M, LA)
- Begin outreach to Tier 1 targets immediately — especially Jay Industrial (CRITICAL) and HECO (risk of becoming competitor platform)
- Target 3-5 motor shop acquisitions by Q1 2027

### Wave 4: Density and Moat (2027)

**Fill remaining gaps:**
- FL depth (Compressed Air Systems, C4)
- LA entry (Pneu-Power, C5)
- SE compressor density (Pattons, C7)
- Specialty turbo (Allied Power, S1)
- Additional motor shops (defensive vs. IPS)

**Charlotte advantage compounds:** By this point, ISG has Charlotte running across 25+ brands in 5 verticals. Every new acquisition plugs into a substrate that already understands the customer, the equipment, the pricing, and the competitive landscape. Integration isn't a project — it's a protocol.

## VALUATION CONTEXT — What Targets Cost

| Vertical | Typical Multiple | Basis | Recent Comparable |
|----------|-----------------|-------|-------------------|
| Compressed air distributors | 6-10x EBITDA | Service-heavy, recurring aftermarket | Air Mac (~$17M rev, sold to Atlas Copco) |
| Valve platforms | 10-14x EBITDA | Specialty manufacturing, severe service | Severn Group ($480M at ~14x), MOGAS ($305M to Flowserve) |
| Pump distributors | 6-10x EBITDA | Distribution + service mix | Pump Solutions ($36.8M rev to DXP at ~1x rev) |
| Motor repair shops | 8-12x EBITDA | Recurring maintenance, skilled labor moat | IPS trajectory (100 locations, Searchlight Capital) |
| Turbomachinery service | 10-15x EBITDA | Highly specialized, barrier to entry | RMS (sold to Arcline, $9.1B AUM firm) |

**Assumption:** ISG targets in the $8-80M revenue range with 12-18% EBITDA margins → acquisition cost of $1-15M per target for smaller shops, $15-80M for larger platforms like Blake & Pendleton or Fischer Process.

**Top 10 acquisitions estimated total capital required: $100-250M**
At ISG's scale with TJC backing, this is a standard PE acquisition facility.

## CHARLOTTE'S ROLE IN EVERY ACQUISITION

For each target acquired, Charlotte executes on Day 1:

1. **Ingest:** Customer data, equipment records, service history, pricing → knowledge graph
2. **Reactivate:** Protocol 2 fires on dormant customers immediately (60/90/180-day tiers)
3. **Price:** Protocol 1 competitive scraping extends to new geography and product lines
4. **Cross-sell:** New customers exposed to full ISG portfolio (compressors + valves + pumps + motors + service agreements)
5. **Lifecycle:** Protocol 4 maps installed base → identifies replacement pipeline
6. **Measure:** ROI tracked per acquisition, per protocol, per customer. Full traceability.

**This is the AI wave hitting the acquisition process.** Two more meetings (ISG Feb 24, TJC March/April) and the gradient is in motion.
