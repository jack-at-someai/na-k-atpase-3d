# Serengeti Farms — App Scouting Tracker

## Scouting Criteria

When evaluating candidate apps for acquisition and reinvention, score each on:

| Criterion | Weight | Description |
|---|---|---|
| **Proven Utility** | 25% | Did this app solve a real problem? Does the need still exist? |
| **Outdated Tech** | 20% | Is the current implementation dated enough that a modern rebuild adds clear value? |
| **Market Size** | 20% | Is the addressable market large enough to justify the investment? |
| **Rebuild Feasibility** | 15% | Can we ship a modern version in 3–6 months with available resources? |
| **Competitive Moat** | 10% | After reinvention, can we defend this position? (Brand, data, network effects) |
| **Revenue Model Clarity** | 10% | Is there a clear path to revenue? (SaaS, marketplace, licensing, ads) |

## Scoring Template

**Total Score = Weighted average across all criteria (1–5 scale per criterion)**

| Score | Meaning |
|---|---|
| 4.5–5.0 | Immediate priority — fast-track to Founders vote |
| 3.5–4.4 | Strong candidate — needs deeper diligence |
| 2.5–3.4 | Watchlist — revisit next tranche |
| Below 2.5 | Pass |

## Sourcing Channels

1. **Prides**: Members surface ideas from their industries and networks
2. **Founders**: Draw from decades of executive experience and deal flow
3. **App graveyard mining**: Scan discontinued/abandoned apps on ProductHunt, AppStore archives, Crunchbase "dead" companies
4. **Industry reports**: Niche verticals with underserved software needs
5. **University partnerships**: Student projects with real utility but no commercialization path

## Evaluation Workflow
