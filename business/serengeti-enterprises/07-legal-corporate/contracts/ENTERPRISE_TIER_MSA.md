**MANAGED SERVICE AGREEMENT**

This Managed Service Agreement ("Agreement") is entered into as of **[DATE]** ("Effective Date") by and between:

**SomeAI Research Lab** ("Provider"), with principal offices at **[ADDRESS]**

and

**[CLIENT LEGAL NAME]** ("Client"), with principal offices at **[ADDRESS]**

collectively referred to as the "Parties."

## 1. DEFINITIONS

**1.1 "Charlotte OS"** means the Provider's proprietary operational intelligence substrate, including all graph infrastructure, signal processing pipelines, protocol engines, and derived analytics capabilities.

**1.2 "Substrate"** means the deployed instance of Charlotte OS configured for the Client's operational domain, including all nodes, edges, metrics, signals, and protocols spanning the Client's sites or member organizations.

**1.3 "Signal History"** means the append-only record of all observations, measurements, and events ingested into the Client's Substrate over time, across all sites.

**1.4 "Protocols"** means the decision frameworks, expected trajectories, drift thresholds, and evaluation criteria configured within the Substrate to generate operational intelligence.

**1.5 "Deliverables"** means the analytics reports, drift alerts, trajectory analyses, cross-site intelligence, and operational intelligence outputs produced by the Provider and delivered to the Client.

**1.6 "Domain Data"** means the raw operational records, measurements, and observations provided by the Client (or the Client's member organizations) for ingestion into the Substrate.

**1.7 "Sites"** means the individual operational locations, facilities, or member organizations covered under this Agreement, as enumerated in Exhibit A.

**1.8 "Protocol Library"** means the centralized collection of validated protocols maintained across all Client Sites, enabling standardized evaluation and cross-site comparison.

---

## 2. SCOPE OF SERVICES

**2.1 Service Model.** This is a managed service engagement covering multiple Sites under a unified Substrate. The Provider deploys, operates, and maintains the Substrate on behalf of the Client. The Client does not access, configure, or operate the Substrate directly. The Client receives Deliverables — not platform access.

**2.2 Onboarding Phase.** The Provider will conduct an initial deployment consisting of:

- (a) Domain discovery and operational walkthrough across designated Sites
- (b) Unified vocabulary configuration (entity types, relationship types, metric definitions) standardized across all Sites
- (c) Historical data import and graph seeding for each Site
- (d) Protocol calibration from historical patterns and domain expertise, including cross-site protocol harmonization
- (e) Protocol Library establishment — centralized, versioned protocol definitions applicable across all Sites
- (f) Validation, test traversals, cross-site analytics verification, and handoff to ongoing service

Estimated onboarding duration: **8–16 weeks** from the Effective Date, subject to timely provision of Domain Data by the Client and site access coordination. Sites may be onboarded in phases as agreed in Exhibit A.

**2.3 Ongoing Services.** Following onboarding, the Provider will deliver:

- (a) **Weekly analytics delivery** — Per-site operational intelligence reports covering entity trajectories, cohort comparisons, and derived metrics
- (b) **Cross-site intelligence** — Comparative analytics across all Sites: benchmarking, performance variance analysis, protocol adherence comparison, and identification of best-performing operations
- (c) **Centralized Protocol Library management** — Unified protocol definitions, versioning, and distribution across all Sites; propagation of protocol improvements discovered at any single Site
- (d) **Custom metric definitions** — Domain-specific derived metrics tailored to the Client's strategic objectives, beyond standard analytics
- (e) **Drift alerts** — Real-time notification when monitored entities at any Site deviate from expected signal trajectories
- (f) **Signal quality monitoring** — Continuous verification of data ingestion completeness and integrity across all Sites
- (g) **Graph maintenance** — Onboarding of new entities, new Sites, and updating of relationships as operations evolve
- (h) **Monthly strategic review** — Cross-site operational review with the Client's leadership team, including trend analysis and strategic recommendations

**2.4 Site Additions.** New Sites may be added during the term of this Agreement by mutual written agreement. Each additional Site will incur a per-site onboarding fee as specified in Exhibit B and will be incorporated into the existing Substrate.

## 3. FEES AND PAYMENT

**3.1 Onboarding Fee.** The Client shall pay a one-time onboarding fee of **$[AMOUNT]** (the "Onboarding Fee"), due as follows:

- 40% upon execution of this Agreement
- 30% upon completion of onboarding for the first Site
- 30% upon completion of onboarding for all initial Sites

**3.2 Monthly Retainer.** Beginning on the first day of the month following completion of the Onboarding Phase for the first Site, the Client shall pay a monthly service retainer of **$[AMOUNT]** (the "Monthly Retainer").

> **Enterprise Tier Range:** $12,000–$35,000/month
> **Onboarding Fee Range:** $15,000–$40,000
> **Per Additional Site Onboarding:** $3,000–$8,000

**3.3 Payment Terms.** All invoices are due within thirty (30) days of the invoice date. Late payments accrue interest at the lesser of 1.5% per month or the maximum rate permitted by applicable law.

**3.4 Annual Adjustment.** The Monthly Retainer may be adjusted annually on the anniversary of the Effective Date. The Provider will give sixty (60) days' written notice of any rate adjustment, which shall not exceed 10% of the prior year's rate without mutual written agreement.

**3.5 Volume Pricing.** If the Client adds Sites that bring the total covered Sites to fifteen (15) or more, the Parties shall negotiate in good faith a revised Monthly Retainer reflecting the increased scope. The per-site marginal cost decreases as the Protocol Library and vocabulary become fully established.

**3.6 Taxes.** All fees are exclusive of applicable taxes. The Client is responsible for all sales, use, and similar taxes arising from this Agreement.

---

## 4. TERM AND RENEWAL

**4.1 Initial Term.** This Agreement shall commence on the Effective Date and continue for an initial term of **thirty-six (36) months** (the "Initial Term").

**4.2 Renewal.** Following the Initial Term, this Agreement shall automatically renew for successive twelve (12) month periods (each a "Renewal Term") unless either Party provides written notice of non-renewal at least ninety (90) days prior to the end of the then-current term.

## 5. DATA OWNERSHIP AND INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY

**5.1 Client Data.** The Client retains ownership of all Domain Data provided to the Provider. The Client grants the Provider a non-exclusive license to use Domain Data solely for the purpose of performing the services described in this Agreement.

**5.2 Provider IP.** Charlotte OS, including all substrate architecture, graph schemas, protocol engines, signal processing pipelines, vocabulary frameworks, Protocol Library structure, cross-site analytics methodologies, and all analytics methodologies, is and remains the exclusive intellectual property of the Provider. Nothing in this Agreement transfers ownership of any Provider IP to the Client.

**5.3 Signal History.** The Signal History generated within the Client's Substrate is jointly derived from the Client's Domain Data and the Provider's proprietary infrastructure. The Signal History resides within the Provider's systems and is not independently exportable in raw form. Upon termination, the Client may request a structured export as described in Section 8.4.

**5.4 Aggregated Intelligence.** The Provider may use anonymized and aggregated data derived from the Client's Substrate — combined with data from other clients — to generate industry benchmarks, trend analyses, and network intelligence products. No individually identifiable Client data will be disclosed without the Client's prior written consent. The Client will receive access to relevant aggregated industry intelligence as part of the Enterprise service tier at no additional cost.

**5.5 Improvements.** Any improvements, modifications, or derivative works to Charlotte OS developed during the performance of this Agreement, including domain-specific vocabulary, protocol templates, cross-site analytics methods, and Protocol Library enhancements, are the exclusive property of the Provider.

**5.6 Member Data.** Where the Client is an industry association or similar organization, individual member Domain Data shall be treated with the same confidentiality protections as Client Data. Cross-member analytics shall only be delivered in anonymized or aggregated form unless explicit written consent is obtained from each affected member.
