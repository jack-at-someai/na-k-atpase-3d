---

## 2. SCOPE OF SERVICES

**2.1 Service Model.** This is a managed service engagement covering the Client's entire portfolio under a unified Substrate. The Provider deploys, operates, and maintains the Substrate on behalf of the Client. Neither the Client nor its Portfolio Companies access, configure, or operate the Substrate directly. The Client receives Deliverables — not platform access. A dedicated account team is assigned to the Client for the duration of this Agreement.

**2.2 Onboarding Phase.** The Provider will conduct an initial deployment consisting of:

- (a) Portfolio-level discovery — Understanding the Client's investment thesis, operational priorities, performance metrics, and reporting requirements
- (b) Per-company domain discovery and operational walkthrough for each initial Portfolio Company
- (c) Unified vocabulary configuration standardized across the portfolio, with company-specific extensions where required
- (d) Historical data import and graph seeding for each Portfolio Company
- (e) Protocol calibration at both individual company and portfolio-wide levels
- (f) Portfolio-wide Protocol Library establishment — centralized, versioned protocol definitions enabling cross-company benchmarking
- (g) Cross-portfolio analytics framework — comparative metrics, performance indices, and portfolio health dashboards
- (h) Validation, test traversals, cross-portfolio analytics verification, and handoff to ongoing service

Estimated onboarding duration: **12–24 weeks** from the Effective Date. Portfolio Companies will be onboarded in phases as agreed in Exhibit A. Partial services will commence as individual companies complete onboarding.

**2.3 Ongoing Services.** Following onboarding, the Provider will deliver:

- (a) **Weekly per-company analytics** — Operational intelligence reports covering entity trajectories, cohort comparisons, and derived metrics for each Portfolio Company
- (b) **Cross-portfolio benchmarking** — Comparative analytics across all Portfolio Companies: performance ranking, operational efficiency indices, protocol adherence comparison, identification of top/bottom performers, and variance analysis
- (c) **Centralized Protocol Library management** — Unified protocol definitions, versioning, and distribution; propagation of best practices discovered at any single Portfolio Company across the portfolio
- (d) **Custom portfolio-level metrics** — Derived metrics aligned with the Client's investment thesis (e.g., operational improvement velocity, integration readiness scores, exit preparation indices)
- (e) **Drift alerts** — Real-time notification when monitored entities at any Portfolio Company deviate from expected signal trajectories, with portfolio-level roll-up of drift frequency and severity
- (f) **Signal quality monitoring** — Continuous verification of data ingestion completeness and integrity across all Portfolio Companies
- (g) **Graph maintenance** — Onboarding of new entities, new Portfolio Companies, and updating of relationships as operations and the portfolio evolve
- (h) **Monthly strategic review** — Portfolio-level operational review with the Client's leadership or investment team, including trend analysis, benchmarking updates, and strategic recommendations
- (i) **Exit preparation reports** — On-demand signal-backed operational assessments for Portfolio Companies approaching exit, including complete Signal History documentation, protocol maturity scores, and trajectory stability analyses

**2.4 Acquisition Due Diligence.** Upon the Client's request, the Provider will perform due diligence integration services for Acquisition Targets:

- (a) Ingest available Acquisition Target data into a sandboxed evaluation substrate
- (b) Map the Acquisition Target's operational vocabulary against the portfolio's existing vocabulary
- (c) Generate a compatibility assessment: signal density comparison, protocol alignment, operational maturity scoring
- (d) Produce a benchmarking report comparing the Acquisition Target against current Portfolio Company performance
- (e) If the acquisition proceeds, integrate the new company into the portfolio Substrate

Due diligence engagements are billed separately as specified in Exhibit B.

**2.5 Portfolio Company Additions.** New Portfolio Companies (whether acquired or newly included) may be added during the term of this Agreement. Each addition will incur a per-company onboarding fee as specified in Exhibit B and will be incorporated into the existing Substrate.

**2.6 Dedicated Account Team.** The Provider shall assign a dedicated account team to the Client, consisting of at minimum:

- (a) An Account Director serving as the Client's primary point of contact
- (b) Domain specialists with expertise in the Client's operational verticals
- (c) Service delivery analysts responsible for day-to-day Substrate operations

The composition of the dedicated team is specified in Exhibit C. The Provider shall not reassign key team members without thirty (30) days' notice to the Client.

## 5. DATA OWNERSHIP AND INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY

**5.1 Client Data.** The Client retains ownership of all Domain Data provided to the Provider by the Client or its Portfolio Companies. The Client grants the Provider a non-exclusive license to use Domain Data solely for the purpose of performing the services described in this Agreement.

**5.2 Provider IP.** Charlotte OS, including all substrate architecture, graph schemas, protocol engines, signal processing pipelines, vocabulary frameworks, Protocol Library structure, cross-portfolio analytics methodologies, benchmarking algorithms, and all analytics methodologies, is and remains the exclusive intellectual property of the Provider. Nothing in this Agreement transfers ownership of any Provider IP to the Client.

**5.3 Signal History.** The Signal History generated within the Client's Substrate is jointly derived from Portfolio Company Domain Data and the Provider's proprietary infrastructure. The Signal History resides within the Provider's systems and is not independently exportable in raw form. Upon termination, the Client may request a structured export as described in Section 8.5.

**5.4 Aggregated Intelligence.** The Provider may use anonymized and aggregated data derived from the Client's Substrate — combined with data from other clients — to generate industry benchmarks, trend analyses, and network intelligence products. No individually identifiable Client or Portfolio Company data will be disclosed without the Client's prior written consent. The Client will receive access to relevant aggregated industry intelligence as part of the Portfolio service tier at no additional cost.

**5.5 Improvements.** Any improvements, modifications, or derivative works to Charlotte OS developed during the performance of this Agreement, including domain-specific vocabulary, protocol templates, cross-portfolio analytics methods, benchmarking methodologies, and due diligence frameworks, are the exclusive property of the Provider.

**5.6 Portfolio Company Data Segregation.** The Provider shall maintain logical separation of Domain Data between Portfolio Companies within the Substrate. Cross-company analytics shall be delivered only to the Client (as portfolio owner), not to individual Portfolio Companies, unless the Client provides written authorization for specific cross-company data sharing.

**5.7 Acquisition Target Data.** Domain Data provided for due diligence purposes under Section 2.4 shall be held in a sandboxed environment. If the acquisition does not proceed, the Provider shall destroy all Acquisition Target data within thirty (30) days of the Client's written notification that the acquisition has been terminated.
