# Charlotte OS — Managed Service Agreement
## Operator Tier

**Classification:** Boilerplate — Adapt Per Engagement

---

**MANAGED SERVICE AGREEMENT**

This Managed Service Agreement ("Agreement") is entered into as of **[DATE]** ("Effective Date") by and between:

**SomeAI Research Lab** ("Provider"), with principal offices at **[ADDRESS]**

and

**[CLIENT LEGAL NAME]** ("Client"), with principal offices at **[ADDRESS]**

collectively referred to as the "Parties."

---

## 1. DEFINITIONS

**1.1 "Charlotte OS"** means the Provider's proprietary operational intelligence substrate, including all graph infrastructure, signal processing pipelines, protocol engines, and derived analytics capabilities.

**1.2 "Substrate"** means the deployed instance of Charlotte OS configured for the Client's operational domain, including all nodes, edges, metrics, signals, and protocols specific to the Client's operation.

**1.3 "Signal History"** means the append-only record of all observations, measurements, and events ingested into the Client's Substrate over time.

**1.4 "Protocols"** means the decision frameworks, expected trajectories, drift thresholds, and evaluation criteria configured within the Substrate to generate operational intelligence.

**1.5 "Deliverables"** means the analytics reports, drift alerts, trajectory analyses, and operational intelligence outputs produced by the Provider and delivered to the Client.

**1.6 "Domain Data"** means the raw operational records, measurements, and observations provided by the Client for ingestion into the Substrate.

---

## 2. SCOPE OF SERVICES

**2.1 Service Model.** This is a managed service engagement. The Provider deploys, operates, and maintains the Substrate on behalf of the Client. The Client does not access, configure, or operate the Substrate directly. The Client receives Deliverables — not platform access.

**2.2 Onboarding Phase.** The Provider will conduct an initial deployment consisting of:

- (a) Domain discovery and operational walkthrough
- (b) Vocabulary configuration (entity types, relationship types, metric definitions)
- (c) Historical data import and graph seeding
- (d) Protocol calibration from historical patterns and domain expertise
- (e) Validation, test traversals, and handoff to ongoing service

Estimated onboarding duration: **4–8 weeks** from the Effective Date, subject to timely provision of Domain Data by the Client.

**2.3 Ongoing Services.** Following onboarding, the Provider will deliver:

- (a) **Weekly analytics delivery** — Operational intelligence reports covering entity trajectories, cohort comparisons, and derived metrics
- (b) **Protocol management** — Ongoing calibration, creation, and refinement of protocols based on operational feedback
- (c) **Drift alerts** — Real-time notification when monitored entities deviate from expected signal trajectories
- (d) **Signal quality monitoring** — Continuous verification of data ingestion completeness and integrity
- (e) **Graph maintenance** — Onboarding of new entities, updating of relationships, creation of new protocols as operations evolve
- (f) **Quarterly review** — In-depth operational review with the Client's designated contact(s)

---

## 3. FEES AND PAYMENT

**3.1 Onboarding Fee.** The Client shall pay a one-time onboarding fee of **$[AMOUNT]** (the "Onboarding Fee"), due as follows:

- 50% upon execution of this Agreement
- 50% upon completion of the Onboarding Phase

**3.2 Monthly Retainer.** Beginning on the first day of the month following completion of the Onboarding Phase, the Client shall pay a monthly service retainer of **$[AMOUNT]** (the "Monthly Retainer").

> **Operator Tier Range:** $3,000–$8,000/month
> **Onboarding Fee Range:** $5,000–$15,000

**3.3 Payment Terms.** All invoices are due within thirty (30) days of the invoice date. Late payments accrue interest at the lesser of 1.5% per month or the maximum rate permitted by applicable law.

**3.4 Annual Adjustment.** The Monthly Retainer may be adjusted annually on the anniversary of the Effective Date. The Provider will give sixty (60) days' written notice of any rate adjustment, which shall not exceed 10% of the prior year's rate without mutual written agreement.

**3.5 Taxes.** All fees are exclusive of applicable taxes. The Client is responsible for all sales, use, and similar taxes arising from this Agreement.

---

## 4. TERM AND RENEWAL

**4.1 Initial Term.** This Agreement shall commence on the Effective Date and continue for an initial term of **twenty-four (24) months** (the "Initial Term").

**4.2 Renewal.** Following the Initial Term, this Agreement shall automatically renew for successive twelve (12) month periods (each a "Renewal Term") unless either Party provides written notice of non-renewal at least ninety (90) days prior to the end of the then-current term.

---

## 5. DATA OWNERSHIP AND INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY

**5.1 Client Data.** The Client retains ownership of all Domain Data provided to the Provider. The Client grants the Provider a non-exclusive license to use Domain Data solely for the purpose of performing the services described in this Agreement.

**5.2 Provider IP.** Charlotte OS, including all substrate architecture, graph schemas, protocol engines, signal processing pipelines, vocabulary frameworks, and analytics methodologies, is and remains the exclusive intellectual property of the Provider. Nothing in this Agreement transfers ownership of any Provider IP to the Client.

**5.3 Signal History.** The Signal History generated within the Client's Substrate is jointly derived from the Client's Domain Data and the Provider's proprietary infrastructure. The Signal History resides within the Provider's systems and is not independently exportable in raw form. Upon termination, the Client may request a structured export of their Domain Data and derived analytics in a standard format (CSV, JSON) as described in Section 8.4.

**5.4 Aggregated Intelligence.** The Provider may use anonymized and aggregated data derived from the Client's Substrate — combined with data from other clients — to generate industry benchmarks, trend analyses, and network intelligence products. No individually identifiable Client data will be disclosed without the Client's prior written consent.

**5.5 Improvements.** Any improvements, modifications, or derivative works to Charlotte OS developed during the performance of this Agreement, including domain-specific vocabulary, protocol templates, and analytics methodologies, are the exclusive property of the Provider.
