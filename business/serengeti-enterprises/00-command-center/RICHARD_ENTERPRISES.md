# Richard Enterprises — The Parent Empire

> *If Wayne Enterprises had both Bruce Wayne AND Tony Stark as sons.*

## What Is Richard Enterprises?

Richard Enterprises is a **private equity holding company and strategic advisory firm** focused on small-to-middle market acquisitions ($5–50M EBITDA). Founded in June 2016, it is the parent entity above all Serengeti operations.

But Richard Enterprises is more than a PE firm. It is a **three-generation family office** where capital allocation, industrial operations, and frontier R&D converge into a single flywheel. Think of it like this:

- **Wayne Enterprises** had the capital, the legacy, the network, the philanthropic mission
- **Stark Industries** had the tech, the engineering genius, the R&D labs, the vision

Richard Enterprises has both. Under one roof.

## The Principals

### Jim Richard — Chairman & CEO ("Thomas Wayne meets Howard Stark")
- Founder of Richard Enterprises
- Career spanning executive leadership across 80,000+ employees
- Expertise: onsite evaluation, strategy development, organic growth analysis, add-on acquisitions
- Network includes: The Carlyle Group, Edgewater Funds, JZ Partners, KKR, BlackRock, AEA Investors
- Role: Capital allocation, CEO coordination, acquisition strategy, Serengeti vision

### Joseph Richard — Operations ("The Steady Hand")
- Operations, engineering management, internal accounting
- The brother who ensures the machine runs
- Intellectual roots: entomology and animal systems (seeded by Dave Genger)
- Role: Operational execution, internal systems, financial controls

### Jack Richard — R&D & Technology ("Tony Stark")
- Northwestern MSAI 2019 (Kris Hammond's cohort)
- Creator of **Charlotte** — the graph-native knowledge infrastructure
- Runs **SomeAI Research Lab** — 37 research projects calibrating the Charlotte substrate
- Academic lineage: Roger Schank → Kris Hammond → Jack Richard
- Mentors: Ken Forbus (qualitative reasoning), Dave Ferrucci (IBM Watson), Louis Rosenberg (swarm intelligence)
- Role: Technical architecture, AI infrastructure, product development, Farms build execution

### Dave Genger — The Origin (1960–2010)
- Science teacher at Lake Forest Country Day School
- Influenced both Jack (robotics → AI) and Joseph (insects → animals)
- Seeded the intellectual curiosity that became SomeAI
- Died three months after Jack's middle school graduation
- His echo persists as a standing wave across both brothers' careers

## The DNA: Wayne + Stark

What makes this empire different from a typical PE shop or tech startup is the **dual inheritance**:

### The Wayne Side (Jim's Legacy)
- **Capital networks**: KKR, Carlyle, BlackRock-tier relationships
- **Operational scale**: 80,000 employees across 16+ industrial brands
- **Mentorship ethic**: The entire Serengeti Prides and Founders model is built on "pay it forward"
- **Institutional patience**: Long-term hold strategy, not pump-and-dump
- **Community building**: Individual investors over institutional capital — deliberate choice

### The Stark Side (Jack's Engine)
- **Charlotte**: A graph-native knowledge graph that formalizes observable reality
- **37 research instruments**: From swarm intelligence to biomimetic materials to chaos theory
- **Academic pedigree**: Northwestern AI, standing on Schank → Hammond → Forbus
- **Technical vision**: "Observable reality as a service" — one substrate, every vertical
- **Build speed**: Sounder MVP, ServiceIQ deployment, 37 calibration projects — all from one engineer

### The Synthesis
Jim brings deals. Jack builds the substrate. Joseph keeps the machine running. Serengeti is where all three converge: **capital meets technology meets operational discipline**.

## Services (Richard Enterprises)

- Onsite evaluation of acquisition targets
- Strategy development for portfolio companies
- Organic growth analysis
- Add-on acquisition identification and execution
- CEO coordination across portfolio
- Charlotte-powered operational intelligence (via ServiceIQ)

## Why This Matters for Serengeti

Serengeti is not a standalone startup. It sits on top of:
1. **An existing industrial empire** (ISG, 80K employees, proven revenue)
2. **A proprietary technology platform** (Charlotte, graph-native, domain-agnostic)
3. **A world-class research pipeline** (SomeAI, 37 projects, biomimicry R&D)
4. **A deep capital network** (Jim's PE relationships spanning decades)

Every Farms portfolio company benefits from this infrastructure. Every Pride member enters an ecosystem backed by real assets, real technology, and real operational experience. This is not a pitch — it's a platform.
