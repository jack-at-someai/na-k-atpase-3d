## Company Position

Certified Pedigree Swine is the largest swine registry in the United States by every measure that matters: 65,412 registered breeders, 5,279 registered herdmarks, and coverage of all recognized breeds -- 10+ purebred lines plus crossbred registrations -- under a single organizational umbrella. No other registry comes close. NSR, the next-largest multi-breed registry, has 3,763 breeders. CPS is 17x larger.

CPS generates revenue from registration fees, membership dues, and show sanctions. The all-breed model is the structural advantage: a breeder raising Durocs, Hampshires, and crossbreds registers everything through one organization rather than managing memberships and paperwork across three or four breed-specific registries. This convenience created a flywheel -- more breeders joined CPS, which made CPS the default, which attracted more breeders. The result is a registry that owns the show pig world.

Geographic concentration tracks the swine belt: Indiana leads with 14,552 breeders (22% of total), followed by Oklahoma (9,177), Texas (9,174), Illinois (5,542), and Ohio (4,047). These five states account for over 65% of CPS membership and represent the core geography of the American show pig industry.

CPS has a basic online portal -- a step above the paper-and-fax operations at NSR and most breed associations -- but the technology remains decades behind commercial genetics platforms. The portal handles basic registration functions but offers no CRM, no analytics, no mobile experience, and no marketplace capabilities. CPS is dominant on scale but vulnerable on technology. It is the biggest player in an industry that has not yet digitized.

## Registry Competitors

### Tier 1: Direct Registry Competitors

| Registry | Type | Breeders | Breeds | Herdmarks | Differentiator |
|----------|------|----------|--------|-----------|----------------|
| **CPS** (Certified Pedigree Swine) | All-breed | 65,412 | All recognized (10+) | 5,279 | Largest registry. All breeds under one umbrella. Dominant in show pig market. Basic online portal. |
| **NSR** (National Swine Registry) | Multi-breed | 3,763 | Hampshire, Duroc, Yorkshire, Landrace | -- | STAGES performance testing. Purdue adjacency. Four-breed merger heritage. Stronger institutional ties to genetics research. |
| **ABA** (American Berkshire Association) | Single-breed | 8,807 | Berkshire | -- | Oldest swine registry in the world (est. 1875). Berkshire Gold meat quality certification. Premium pork positioning. |
| **NSIF** (National Swine Improvement Federation) | Standards body | N/A | All | -- | Not a registry. Sets genetic evaluation standards and EPD protocols. |

### Tier 2: Individual Breed Associations

| Association | Breed | Relationship to CPS |
|-------------|-------|---------------------|
| Chester White Swine Record | Chester White | Registered through CPS |
| National Spotted Swine Record | Spot | Registered through CPS |
| American Poland China Record | Poland China | Registered through CPS |
| Hereford Hog Record Association | Hereford | Small, specialty breed |
| American Tamworth Swine Record | Tamworth | Small, heritage breed |

### Key Registry Dynamics

- **CPS manages the overlap breeds.** Chester White, Spot, and Poland China registrations flow through CPS. This means CPS is not just a registry -- it is the administrative backbone for multiple breed associations that would otherwise operate independently.
- **The dual-registration problem.** CPS and NSR share breed coverage for Duroc, Hampshire, Yorkshire, and Landrace. A breeder can register the same animal with both organizations, creating two disconnected pedigree records with two different registration numbers and no cross-reference. This fragments the genetic record and creates confusion for buyers, breeders, and downstream traceability.
- **NSR is not the threat.** At 3,763 breeders, NSR is 17x smaller than CPS. NSR's value is institutional (STAGES, Purdue, research credibility) rather than scale-based. CPS does not lose sleep over NSR membership numbers.
- **ABA is the brand story.** ABA's 8,807 members demonstrate that breed-specific loyalty can sustain a registry -- but only when paired with a premium product narrative (Berkshire Gold). No other breed has replicated this model.

## Commercial Genetics Threats

The real threat to CPS is not NSR or ABA. It is the commercial genetics companies that are systematically replacing purebred seedstock programs with proprietary closed-nucleus lines. These companies do not compete with CPS for registrations -- they eliminate the need for registration entirely.

### Tier 1: Global Vertically Integrated Genetics Companies

| Company | HQ | Revenue | Model | Threat Level |
|---------|-----|---------|-------|-------------|
| **PIC** (Pig Improvement Company) | Hendersonville, TN (Genus plc, $2B+ market cap) | ~$600M+ | Closed nucleus herds. Proprietary terminal and maternal lines. Genomic selection. Vertically integrated genetics-to-data platform. | **Critical** |
| **Topigs Norsvin** | Netherlands / Canada | ~$400M+ | European genetics cooperative. TN70 sow line is the global benchmark. Proprietary genomic tools and data platforms. | **Critical** |
| **DNA Genetics** | Columbus, NE | ~$100M+ | US-focused. 240+ sow units. Growing Midwest market share. Direct competitor to PIC in commercial space. | **High** |
| **Genesus** | Oakville, MB (Canada) | ~$200M+ | Largest privately owned swine genetics company. Duroc, Yorkshire, Landrace lines. | **High** |

### Why CPS Survives (For Now)

CPS survives because the commercial genetics companies have not come for the show pig market. PIC, Topigs Norsvin, DNA Genetics, and Genesus optimize for commercial traits -- feed conversion, days to market, carcass yield. The show pig market optimizes for phenotype, structure, and breed character. These are different selection criteria producing different animals for different buyers.

But this insulation is not permanent:

1. **Market share erosion is structural.** US hog operations have declined from 600,000+ in the 1980s to ~67,000 today. Larger operations buy commercial genetics packages. Smaller operations -- the ones who register with CPS -- are disappearing.
2. **The purebred-to-commercial pipeline is narrowing.** Purebred seedstock once fed commercial production. Now proprietary lines dominate. The economic justification for maintaining purebred herds shrinks with every closed-nucleus genetic program that outperforms open purebred lines.
3. **Data asymmetry is extreme.** PIC operates proprietary genomic databases with millions of genotyped animals. CPS has pedigree records on paper and in a basic portal. The data gap between commercial genetics and purebred registries widens every year.

CPS's survival depends on the show pig market and the youth pipeline (4-H/FFA). These are real markets -- $500M-$1B annually -- but they are the last redoubt, not a growth story.

## Technology Landscape

CPS has a basic online portal, which places it ahead of NSR (largely paper-based) and most individual breed associations. But "ahead of NSR" is a low bar. The portal handles core registration functions -- submitting litter registrations, looking up pedigrees, managing herdmarks -- but the technology gap between CPS and modern expectations remains enormous.

### Current State Assessment

| Function | CPS Current State | What Should Exist |
|----------|------------------|-------------------|
| Pedigree registration | Basic online portal | Real-time digital registration with genomic verification, mobile-first |
| Breeder directory | Online listing (5,279 herdmarks) | Graph-connected breeder network with genetics lineage, sale history, show records |
| CRM / member management | No real CRM | Automated engagement, segmentation, lifecycle marketing, churn prediction |
| Analytics | Limited or none | Breeder-facing dashboards -- registration trends, breed demand, geographic heat maps |
| Mobile experience | No dedicated mobile | Native mobile app for pedigree lookup, registration, show check-in |
| Show management | Manual processes for many functions | Digital entry, automated class building, real-time results, livestream integration |
| Marketplace / sales | Not in the transaction loop | Pedigree-verified listings, payment processing, automatic ownership transfer |
| Traceability | Not addressed | USDA electronic ID integration, chain-of-custody from breeder to buyer |
| Communication | Traditional channels | Real-time notifications, data dashboards, community platform |

### The Portal Gap

CPS's portal is a step above paper -- but it is still a form-submission tool, not a platform. There is no intelligence layer. No analytics. No breeder-to-breeder connectivity. No marketplace. The portal digitized the form; it did not digitize the workflow. A breeder can register a litter online but cannot see how their genetics connect to the broader breed population, cannot discover buyers, cannot benchmark their operation against peers, and cannot access any of the data CPS holds about their own breeding program.

The portal is 2005 technology serving a 2026 market. It works. It is not enough.

### The Facebook Sales Channel

Facebook Messenger is the dominant informal sales channel in the show pig industry -- and CPS is completely outside of it. A breeder posts photos to a Facebook group, buyers send DMs, price is negotiated in chat, payment is sent via Venmo or Zelle, and pedigree papers are mailed weeks later. This workflow generates zero structured data for CPS. No pedigree trail for crossbred animals. No buyer protection. No market intelligence. No transaction revenue.

The Facebook Messenger pedigree transfer latency averages 60 days -- compared to 30 days for formal auction sales. In many cases, the transfer never happens at all. CPS has 65,412 breeders conducting hundreds of millions of dollars in transactions through a channel CPS cannot see, cannot measure, and cannot monetize.

### The 60% Crossbred Gap

Over 60% of crossbred show pigs have no pedigree trail connecting them back to their purebred parents. A Hampshire x Duroc cross sold at a jackpot show has no record linking it to the Hampshire dam's CPS registration or the Duroc sire's genetics. With CPS covering all breeds, it is uniquely positioned to close this gap -- but only with technology that can link purebred registrations to crossbred offspring at the point of sale. Today, that linkage does not exist.

## Market Sizing

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| CPS registered breeders | 65,412 |
| CPS registered herdmarks | 5,279 |
| CPS breeds covered | 10+ purebred + crossbred |
| Top state: Indiana | 14,552 breeders |
| Top 5 states combined | 42,492 breeders (65% of total) |
| NSR breeders (comparison) | 3,763 |
| ABA members (comparison) | 8,807 |
| US show pig segment (est.) | $500M -- $1B annually |
| US swine industry (total) | $26B+ annually |
| US hog operations | ~67,000 |
| Youth involvement (4-H/FFA) | Active in all 50 states |
| Registration fee range (industry avg) | ~$5-15 per animal |
| Sounder total breeders mapped | 77,982+ |
| Sounder total facts ingested | 401,000+ |

### Revenue Dynamics

CPS's 65,412 breeders represent the largest captive audience in the purebred swine industry. At average registration fees of $5-15 per animal, with breeders registering anywhere from 10 to 200+ animals per year, CPS's registration revenue likely sits in the $5-15M range -- making it the largest revenue generator among purebred registries.

But like all registries, CPS captures only the registration fee. It does not participate in the transaction economics of animal sales. A show pig sold for $5,000 on Facebook generates a $5-15 registration transfer fee for CPS -- if the transfer happens at all. The registry captures fractions of a percent of the total economic value flowing through its breeder network.

### The Youth Pipeline

4-H and FFA programs are the feeder system for the show pig industry and, by extension, for CPS membership. Every county fair, every state fair, every jackpot show is a gateway for a young person to become a breeder. CPS is the registry they encounter first because CPS covers all breeds. A 4-H kid showing a crossbred barrow at the county fair is a future CPS member. This pipeline is CPS's most durable competitive advantage -- and it is entirely analog. No digital onboarding. No youth-specific tools. No pathway from "first show pig" to "registered breeder" that does not involve paper forms.

## Threat Landscape

### Existential Threats (5-Year Horizon)

| Threat | Probability | Impact | Current CPS Response |
|--------|------------|--------|---------------------|
| Commercial genetics replacing purebred seedstock at scale | **Very High** | Structural decline in registration volume outside show pig segment | None visible |
| USDA electronic ID mandate with no CPS digital infrastructure | **High** | Members forced to third-party compliance tools, bypassing CPS | None |
| Genomic selection tools from commercial companies entering show pig evaluation | **High** | Show pig selection shifts from visual appraisal to data-driven -- CPS has no data platform | None |
| Facebook/Meta formalizing marketplace features for livestock sales | **Medium** | Transaction layer permanently outside registry reach | None |
| NSR or ABA building digital tools first, proving the model | **Medium** | CPS loses first-mover advantage despite having 17x the scale | None |
| Aging membership with no digital-native onboarding | **High** | Youth pipeline leaks as next-gen breeders expect digital experiences | Youth programs exist but are not digitized |
| Breed-specific registries pulling out of CPS umbrella | **Low** | Fragmentation of all-breed advantage | Unlikely but possible if CPS fails to modernize |

### Structural Vulnerabilities

1. **Scale without technology is a wasting asset.** 65,412 breeders is a massive network -- but without digital tools, that network generates no network effects. Breeders do not connect through CPS. They connect through Facebook. CPS has the membership list; Facebook has the engagement.

2. **The all-breed umbrella is a convenience moat, not a technology moat.** CPS won by making it easy to register all breeds in one place. That convenience advantage evaporates the moment a competitor offers a digital platform that is more convenient than CPS's portal, regardless of breed coverage.

3. **No data monetization.** CPS holds the most comprehensive breeder dataset in the US swine industry -- 65,412 breeders, 5,279 herdmarks, breed specializations, geographic distribution, registration histories. This data generates zero revenue beyond registration fees. No analytics products. No market intelligence. No breeder benchmarking. The data sits idle.

4. **The dual-registration problem costs everyone.** Breeders dual-registering with CPS and NSR pay twice, manage two sets of paperwork, and create fragmented pedigree records. The industry needs one unified record per animal. CPS has the scale to be that unified record -- but not the technology.

## Sounder Thesis for CPS

**"The registry that digitizes first becomes the platform. CPS has the scale to be that platform."**

Sounder has already mapped all 65,412 CPS breeders, cataloged all 5,279 herdmarks, indexed breed specializations across 10+ breeds, and modeled the geographic topology of the CPS network across all 50 states. The Sounder knowledge graph contains 401,000+ facts about the US swine breeding industry -- and CPS breeders represent 84% of the total breeder population mapped.

CPS is not just another registry to digitize. CPS is the critical mass. At 65,412 breeders, CPS has the network density required to create a true industry platform -- one where network effects compound, where data generates intelligence, and where the registry becomes the operating system for the breeding industry.

### What Sounder Delivers to CPS

1. **Platform transformation.** CPS goes from registry to platform. The basic online portal becomes a full-stack digital infrastructure: real-time registration, mobile pedigree lookup, breeder-to-breeder connectivity, analytics dashboards, and marketplace capabilities. CPS stops being a form-submission tool and becomes the place where breeders run their operations.

2. **The breeder graph.** Sounder's knowledge graph connects CPS's 65,412 breeders not just as a membership list but as a network -- linked by genetics, geography, breed specialization, show history, and sale relationships. A breeder searching for a Hampshire boar does not browse a static directory. They navigate a graph that surfaces the right genetics from the right breeder with the right track record.

3. **Cross-registry resolution.** Sounder already holds breeder data from CPS (65,412), NSR (3,763), and ABA (8,807). The dual-registration problem is solvable: Sounder can match animals across registries, unify pedigree records, and give breeders a single view of their genetics regardless of which registries they use. CPS, as the largest registry, becomes the anchor of this unified record.

4. **Show pig marketplace.** The $500M-$1B show pig market flows through Facebook Messenger with zero registry participation. Sounder gives CPS a pedigree-verified marketplace: listings with verified genetics, integrated payment, automatic ownership transfer, and market intelligence. Every transaction generates data. Every data point strengthens the platform.

5. **Youth pipeline digitization.** The 4-H/FFA pathway from first show pig to registered breeder becomes a digital journey. Mobile-first tools for young exhibitors. Digital pedigree cards. Show results that follow the animal and the exhibitor. CPS captures the next generation where they already live -- on their phones.

6. **USDA traceability readiness.** When the electronic ID mandate arrives, CPS members on the Sounder platform are already compliant. Pedigree records, ownership transfers, and electronic identification are unified. CPS becomes the compliance solution for 65,412 breeders rather than a compliance obstacle.

### The Scale Argument

NSR has 3,763 breeders. ABA has 8,807. CPS has 65,412. In platform economics, scale is everything. Network effects require critical mass. A marketplace with 3,763 participants is a bulletin board. A marketplace with 65,412 participants is an industry platform. CPS is the only registry with the breeder density to generate true network effects -- where every new feature, every new data point, and every new transaction makes the platform more valuable for everyone on it.

Consider the numbers: 65,412 breeders across all 50 states, 5,279 active herdmarks, 10+ breeds under one umbrella, and the entire youth pipeline funneling through CPS shows and sanctioned events. This is not a niche. This is the industry. And the industry is waiting for a platform.

### The Positioning

CPS does not need to become a technology company. CPS needs to be the first registry on a platform that already understands its data, its members, and its competitive landscape. Sounder has already done the work. The 65,412 breeders are mapped. The 5,279 herdmarks are cataloged. The breed specializations are indexed. The geographic topology is modeled. The knowledge graph -- 401,000+ facts built on a first-order logic substrate of NODEs, EDGEs, METRICs, SIGNALs, and PROTOCOLs -- is built.

CPS with Sounder is not a registry with a better website. It is the operating system for the American swine breeding industry. The all-breed umbrella that gave CPS its scale advantage becomes the all-breed platform that gives it an ecosystem advantage. Registration, pedigree, marketplace, show management, traceability, analytics -- unified under one roof, because CPS already has every breeder under one roof.

The question is not whether CPS will digitize. The question is whether CPS digitizes first -- and becomes the platform -- or digitizes second, and becomes a feature on someone else's.

The registry that digitizes first becomes the platform. CPS has the scale to be that platform.
