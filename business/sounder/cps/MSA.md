## 3. FEES, REVENUE SHARING, AND PAYMENT

### Phase 1 -- Registry Modernization

**3.1 Platform Build Fee.** During the Registry Modernization Phase (months 1 through 8), CPS shall pay Sounder a one-time platform development fee in the range of **$35,000 to $50,000** (the "Build Fee"), with the exact amount to be determined upon completion of a detailed scope assessment, including an audit of the Existing Portal and data migration requirements, within thirty (30) days of the Effective Date and memorialized in a written amendment to this Agreement. The Build Fee reflects the substantial scope of multi-breed platform development, migration of 65,000+ breeder records, integration of 5,279 herdmarks, and replacement of the Existing Portal.

**3.2 Build Fee Payment Schedule.** The Build Fee shall be payable in four (4) milestone-based installments:

| Milestone | Payment | Timing |
|-----------|---------|--------|
| Project Kickoff & Data Migration Commencement | 30% of Build Fee | Upon Effective Date |
| Data Migration Complete & Registration Engine Beta | 30% of Build Fee | Upon verified migration of Historical Records and functional multi-breed registration beta (est. Month 3) |
| Show Management Platform & Breeder Portal Beta | 20% of Build Fee | Upon delivery of show management system and breeder portal beta (est. Month 5) |
| Platform Go-Live & Existing Portal Decommission | 20% of Build Fee | Upon production launch and successful parallel operation period (est. Month 8) |

### Phase 2 -- Platform Operations

**3.3 Monthly Base Fee.** Beginning in Month 9 and continuing throughout the term of this Agreement, CPS shall pay Sounder a monthly base fee in the range of **$8,000 to $15,000** (the "Base Fee"), with the exact amount to be determined based on the final scope of ongoing services, network scale, and operational complexity, and memorialized in a written amendment prior to the commencement of Phase 2.

### Revenue Sharing

**3.4 Per-Registration Fee.** For each animal registration processed through the Platform (including new registrations, litter notifications, and transfers of ownership across all breeds and crossbred designations), Sounder shall receive a technology fee of **$1.50 to $2.50 per registration** (the "Registration Technology Fee"). The per-unit rate reflects the high volume of registrations processed through CPS annually. The exact fee shall be established prior to Platform go-live and shall be collected by CPS as part of the standard registration fee and remitted to Sounder monthly. The Registration Technology Fee shall not increase the total registration fee charged to breeders without mutual written agreement.

**3.5 Breeder Subscription Revenue.** Sounder shall offer BarnOS Premium subscription features to members of the Breeder Network at a monthly subscription price of **$50 to $100 per breeder** (the "Premium Subscription"). Revenue from Premium Subscriptions shall be split as follows:

| Party | Share | Rationale |
|-------|-------|-----------|
| Sounder | 70% | Platform development, hosting, support |
| CPS | 30% | Breeder network access, institutional endorsement |

Given the scale of CPS's Breeder Network (65,412 breeders), even modest adoption rates represent substantial revenue. At 5% adoption (approximately 3,270 breeders), Premium Subscription revenue would range from $163,500 to $327,000 per month before split.

**3.6 Data Licensing Revenue.** Revenue generated from the sale of anonymized, aggregated industry analytics products derived from Platform data shall be split as follows:

| Party | Share | Rationale |
|-------|-------|-----------|
| Sounder | 60% | Analytics development, infrastructure, sales |
| CPS | 40% | Source data access, institutional credibility, industry relationships |

All data licensing products shall be subject to the data governance provisions of Section 5. No individually identifiable breeder data or proprietary breed standard information shall be included in data licensing products without CPS's prior written approval.

**3.7 Show Management Fees.** For each CPS-sanctioned show or exhibition managed through the Platform, Sounder shall receive a technology fee of **$500 to $1,000 per event** (the "Show Management Fee"), depending on show size, breed divisions, and complexity. CPS sanctions approximately 200+ shows annually. Show Management Fee revenue shall be split as follows:

| Party | Share | Rationale |
|-------|-------|-----------|
| Sounder | 50% | Platform tools, technical support, results processing |
| CPS | 50% | Show sanctioning, judge coordination, event authority |

**3.8 Herdmark Management Fee.** For each active herdmark maintained in the Platform, Sounder shall receive an annual technology fee of **$5.00 per herdmark per year** (the "Herdmark Management Fee"). With 5,279 active herdmarks, annual Herdmark Management Fee revenue is approximately $26,395. Herdmark Management Fee revenue shall be split as follows:

| Party | Share | Rationale |
|-------|-------|-----------|
| Sounder | 80% | Herdmark system digitization, maintenance, tracking |
| CPS | 20% | Herdmark governance, assignment authority |

**3.9 Revenue Reporting.** Sounder shall provide CPS with a monthly revenue report detailing all Revenue Streams, including: (a) total registrations processed by breed and Registration Technology Fees earned; (b) active Premium Subscriptions and associated revenue; (c) data licensing sales and associated revenue; (d) shows managed and Show Management Fees earned; and (e) active herdmarks and Herdmark Management Fees earned. Reports shall be delivered by the tenth (10th) business day of each month for the preceding month's activity.

**3.10 Revenue Share Payments.** CPS's share of Revenue Stream income shall be calculated monthly and paid within thirty (30) days of the revenue report described in Section 3.9. Sounder's share of revenues collected by CPS (Registration Technology Fees) shall be remitted to Sounder within thirty (30) days of collection.

**3.11 Audit Rights.** Each Party shall have the right, upon thirty (30) days' written notice and no more than once per calendar year, to audit the other Party's books and records related to Revenue Streams at the auditing Party's expense. If an audit reveals an underpayment of more than 5%, the underpaying Party shall bear the cost of the audit and remit the underpayment within thirty (30) days.

### General Payment Terms

**3.12 Payment Terms.** All invoices are due within thirty (30) days of the invoice date. Invoices for the Base Fee are issued on the first business day of each month. Late payments accrue interest at the lesser of 1.5% per month or the maximum rate permitted by applicable law.

**3.13 Taxes.** All fees and revenue share payments are exclusive of applicable taxes. Each Party is responsible for its own tax obligations arising from income received under this Agreement.

**3.14 Trogdon Farms.** For clarity, the Trogdon Farms Founding Partner Agreement referenced in Section 1.15 is a separate arrangement between Sounder and Trogdon Farms. Trogdon Farms' access to BarnOS does not affect CPS's obligations or revenue share under this Agreement. Registrations submitted by Trogdon Farms through the Platform are subject to the same Registration Technology Fee as all other breeders.
