### Revenue Sharing

**3.4 Per-Registration Fee.** For each animal registration processed through the Platform (including new registrations, litter notifications, and transfers of ownership), Sounder shall receive a technology fee of **$2.00 to $3.00 per registration** (the "Registration Technology Fee"). The exact fee shall be established prior to Platform go-live and shall be collected by TSA as part of the standard registration fee and remitted to Sounder monthly. The Registration Technology Fee shall not increase the total registration fee charged to breeders without mutual written agreement.

**3.5 Breeder Subscription Revenue.** Sounder shall offer BarnOS Premium subscription features to members of the Breeder Network at a monthly subscription price of **$50 to $100 per breeder** (the "Premium Subscription"). Revenue from Premium Subscriptions shall be split as follows:

| TSA | 40% | Source data access, institutional credibility, heritage breed authority |

All data licensing products shall be subject to the data governance provisions of Section 5. No individually identifiable breeder data or proprietary Breed Standard information shall be included in data licensing products without TSA's prior written approval.

**3.8 Revenue Reporting.** Sounder shall provide TSA with a monthly revenue report detailing all Revenue Streams, including: (a) total registrations processed and Registration Technology Fees earned; (b) active Premium Subscriptions and associated revenue; (c) Heritage Pork Certifications issued and associated revenue; and (d) data licensing sales and associated revenue. Reports shall be delivered by the tenth (10th) business day of each month for the preceding month's activity.

**3.9 Revenue Share Payments.** TSA's share of Revenue Stream income shall be calculated monthly and paid within thirty (30) days of the revenue report described in Section 3.8. Sounder's share of revenues collected by TSA (Registration Technology Fees, Certification Fees) shall be remitted to Sounder within thirty (30) days of collection.

**3.10 Audit Rights.** Each Party shall have the right, upon thirty (30) days' written notice and no more than once per calendar year, to audit the other Party's books and records related to Revenue Streams at the auditing Party's expense.

**3.13 Trogdon Farms.** For clarity, the Trogdon Farms Founding Partner Agreement referenced in Section 1.11 is a separate arrangement between Sounder and Trogdon Farms. Trogdon Farms' access to BarnOS does not affect TSA's obligations or revenue share under this Agreement. Registrations submitted by Trogdon Farms through the Platform are subject to the same Registration Technology Fee as all other breeders.
