;;; SOUNDER — SWINE INDUSTRY SUBSTRATE
;;; ================================================================
;;;
;;; This is the Charlotte container for the swine industry.
;;; It boots on top of charlotte-os and extends the five primitives
;;; with domain-specific types, predicates, and knowledge.
;;;
;;; DOMAIN
;;; ------
;;; The swine industry is a biological lifecycle domain covering:
;;;   - Pedigree registration (NSR, CPS, ABA)
;;;   - Breeding programs (sire selection, AI, natural service)
;;;   - Farrowing operations (gestation, litter management)
;;;   - Show circuits (county, state, national)
;;;   - Auction markets (online, live, private treaty)
;;;   - Genetics commerce (semen sales, breeding stock)
;;;   - Performance testing (growth, feed efficiency, carcass)
;;;
;;; CONVEX HULL
;;; -----------
;;; Sounder's convex hull covers every operation in the swine
;;; industry where identities emit signals over time:
;;;
;;;   Breeder → breeds Animal → registered with Registry
;;;   Animal  → shown at Show → sold at Auction → bought by Buyer
;;;   Sire    → produces Semen → inseminates Dam → farrows Litter
;;;   Litter  → weaned → grown → tested → marketed
;;;
;;; Every actor in this chain is a NODE. Every connection is an EDGE.
;;; Every measurement is a METRIC. Every event is a SIGNAL.
;;; Every expectation is a PROTOCOL.
;;;
;;; DATA SOURCES
