**1.3 "Signal History"** means the append-only record of all observations, measurements, and events ingested into the Substrate over time, including job data, crew performance, route records, billing, collection, and customer satisfaction signals.

**1.4 "Protocols"** means the decision frameworks, expected trajectories, drift thresholds, and evaluation criteria configured within the Substrate to generate operational intelligence.

**1.5 "Deliverables"** means the analytics dashboards, crew performance reports, route intelligence, drift alerts, dispatch recommendations, and operational outputs produced by the Technology Partner.

**1.6 "Domain Data"** means the raw operational records, job manifests, crew assignments, billing records, collection data, route histories, and customer records provided by the Industry Partner for ingestion into the Substrate.

---

## 2. SCOPE OF PARTNERSHIP

**2.1 Partnership Model.** This is a strategic technology partnership. The Technology Partner provides Charlotte OS infrastructure to build operational intelligence for the Industry Partner's nationwide moving operations. The Industry Partner provides job data, crew performance records, and route histories spanning 10,600+ jobs across 98 crew members. Both Parties benefit from the resulting platform capabilities.

**2.2 Phase 1 — Foundation (Months 1–6).** During the Foundation Phase, the Technology Partner will deploy:

- (a) **Crew performance substrate** — Every crew member modeled as a NODE with revenue, collection rate, job count, state coverage, volume moved, and tier classification. Historical data from Nov 2021 onward ingested.
- (b) **Job lifecycle pipeline** — Every job ingested as a SIGNAL with booking date, crew assignment, origin, destination, weight, volume, billing amount, collection amount, and settlement status.
- (c) **Route intelligence** — City-to-city EDGE mapping with frequency, revenue density, weight moved, and seasonal patterns across all 3,675 cities served.
- (d) **Collection analytics** — Per-crew and per-route collection rate tracking with historical trends and crew-to-crew benchmarking.
- (e) **Crew tier system** — Automated MVP/All-Star/Starter/Rookie classification with promotion and demotion signals based on rolling 90-day performance.
- (f) **Dashboard deployment** — Interactive crew baseball cards (existing), company dashboard, and route map visualization.

**2.3 Phase 2 — Operations (Months 7–24).** Following the Foundation Phase, the Technology Partner will expand to:

- (a) **Collection forecasting** — Predictive model for payment risk at booking time based on crew, route, estimate type, job size, and seasonal patterns.
- (b) **Dispatch intelligence** — Crew-to-job matching recommendations based on historical performance, current location, availability, and route proficiency.
- (c) **Seasonal demand forecasting** — Predictive staffing recommendations by region and month based on 3.5 years of booking patterns.
- (d) **Drift alerts** — Real-time notification when monitored metrics deviate from expected trajectories: collection rate drops, crew performance decline, route revenue shifts, seasonal anomalies.
- (e) **Customer experience tracking** — NPS and satisfaction signals linked to crew and route performance for continuous improvement.
- (f) **Weekly operations brief** — Crew performance, collection status, route trends, and dispatch recommendations delivered weekly.
- (g) **Quarterly strategic review** — Partnership review with leadership, including growth analysis, competitive positioning, and infrastructure expansion planning.
