|---|---|---|---|
| Charlotte substrate (core engine) | SomeAI / Jack Richard | Serengeti Enterprises | TBD — internal use license |
| Charlotte substrate | SomeAI / Jack Richard | ISG / ServiceIQ | TBD — commercial deployment license |
| Sounder app (UI + domain logic) | Sounder Enterprises, LLC | — | Owned outright |
| Nightlife app (UI + domain logic) | Nightlife Platform, LLC | — | Owned outright |
| Research instruments (37 projects) | SomeAI / Jack Richard | — | Internal R&D |

**Action item**: Formalize Charlotte licensing agreement between SomeAI and Serengeti Enterprises before Farms #1 closes.
