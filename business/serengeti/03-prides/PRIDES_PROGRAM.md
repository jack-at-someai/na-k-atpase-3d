# Serengeti Prides — Leadership Program

> *"If you want to go fast, go alone. If you want to go far, go with your pride." — African Proverb*

## Mission

The Serengeti Prides Leadership Program is designed for ambitious professionals in their 20s and 30s who are ready to transform their careers. Through personalized learning, hands-on exercises, and expert mentorship, members gain the skills and confidence to lead with impact.

## The Problem We Solve

The leadership development gap is massive and well-documented:

- Average age of first-time managers: **30 years old**
- Average age they receive leadership training: **42 years old**
- That's a **12-year gap** of leading without formal development (Center for Creative Leadership)
- Only **28%** of millennials feel their leadership skills are being fully developed (Deloitte)
- **87%** of employees value leadership development, but only **29%** feel their company provides it (McKinsey)
- Poor leadership costs U.S. companies over **$500 billion annually** in lost productivity (Gallup)

## Program Structure

## Charlotte Integration

Pride member development is tracked on the Charlotte substrate:

| Charlotte Primitive | Prides Application |
|---|---|
| **Node** | Each Pride member, mentor, cohort |
| **Signal** | Assessment scores (MBTI, EQ, 360), session attendance, Hot Seat participation, ideas contributed |
| **Edge** | MEMBER_OF (cohort), MENTORED_BY (Founder), CONTRIBUTED_TO (Farms idea) |
| **Protocol** | Bi-weekly meeting attendance, quarterly assessment, annual Summit participation |
| **Metric** | Leadership clarity score, engagement rate, idea-to-Farms conversion rate |

This means:
- **Real-time engagement tracking** — know who's active, who's drifting
- **Signal-based progress** — leadership growth measured over time, not snapshots
- **Farms pipeline integration** — when a Pride member surfaces an app idea, it's tracked as a signal that flows directly into the Farms scouting pipeline
- **Mentor effectiveness** — which Founders are producing the best outcomes?

## The Pride-to-Farms Pipeline

This is the critical feedback loop in the Serengeti flywheel. Pride members are the idea scouts:

```
Pride member identifies an outdated app in their industry
  → Submits as a Charlotte signal (CONTRIBUTED_TO → Farms Pipeline)
    → Research team scores it (48hr turnaround)
      → If score ≥ 3.5 → Deep diligence
        → Present to Founders with full scorecard
          → If selected → Pride member earns equity in the resulting company
```

This creates a direct financial incentive for Pride members to actively participate. Their industry knowledge becomes **deal flow** for Farms, and their equity stake becomes **retention** for Prides.
