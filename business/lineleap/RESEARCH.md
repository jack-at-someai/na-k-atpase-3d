## 2. Founding & Origin Story

### The Founders

| Name | Role | University | Notes |
|------|------|-----------|-------|
| **Max Schauff** | Co-Founder / CMO | University of Wisconsin-Madison ('19) | From Belleville, WI; engineering student; early campus food-delivery experience gave him an email list he leveraged for launch |
| **Patrick Skelly** | Co-Founder / CEO | University of Michigan | Now based in NYC; leads business strategy |
| **Nick Becker** | Co-Founder | University of Michigan | Now based in NYC |
| **Jack Pawlik** | Co-Founder | University of Wisconsin-Madison ('19) | Present at the original launch night |

### The Launch Night

On a bitterly cold February 2017 night (negative-five degrees Fahrenheit), Schauff and Pawlik set up outside **Whiskey Jacks Saloon** on State Street in Madison, Wisconsin. Schauff had built up an email contact list from a prior campus food-delivery startup, which he used to promote a beer special and sell the first "LineSkip" passes. In Schauff's words: *"We were close to frostbitten on our hands and noses. But we sold a ton of LineSkips."*

### The Scrappy Growth Phase

After proving the concept worked on night one, the cofounders spent **summer breaks loading into a car** and driving from college town to college town, pitching venue owners. They slept in beat-up motels and sometimes in their cars. The initial product was bare-bones: a mobile pass that let you skip the line at a partner bar.

## 6. Business Model

LineLeap operates a **multi-sided marketplace**:

1. **Consumer transaction fees** — revenue share on every LineSkip, cover charge, ticket, and drink order processed through the app
2. **Venue SaaS + revenue share** — venues get the platform and in return LineLeap takes a cut of digitized transactions
3. **Brand partnerships** — brands pay for access to LineLeap's verified 21+ audience in experiential nightlife settings
4. **Data and analytics** — proprietary consumer behavior data in the nightlife vertical

The long-term vision: **control a high percentage of transactions at every venue in the country and become the mobile point of sale for the $100B nightlife and entertainment industry.**

---

## 7. Competitive Landscape

| Competitor | Focus | How LineLeap Differs |
|-----------|-------|---------------------|
| **Discotech** | Nightclub discovery, guest lists, table reservations | LineLeap is deeper on the transaction layer (line-skip, cover, drinks, tickets) and heavier on the venue CRM/analytics side |
| **Barpay** | Mobile drink ordering at bars | LineLeap bundles drink ordering with line-skip, cover, tickets — full nightlife stack |
| **Srvd** | Nightlife ordering | Narrower product surface |
| **NightUp** | Nightlife events | Events-focused vs. LineLeap's venue-operations focus |
| **Crawl Technologies** | Bar crawl organization + line skip | Niche use-case vs. LineLeap's platform breadth |
| **Eventbrite / Tock** | General event ticketing / restaurant reservations | Not nightlife-native; LineLeap owns the bar/club vertical specifically |
| **SeatGeek / Ticketmaster** | Large-venue ticketing | Focused on concerts/sports; don't touch bar-level operations, cover charges, or drink orders |

LineLeap's moat: **network density in college towns and nightlife districts**, proprietary venue-level transaction data, and a verified 21+ audience that brands cannot easily reach elsewhere.

2. **Brand revenue stream** — Hiring Patrick Burke as Chief Partnerships Officer indicates aggressive pursuit of CPG/alcohol brand budgets. LineLeap's pitch: *"We are the only platform where brands can reach verified 21+ consumers at the exact moment of consumption."*

3. **Full venue digitization** — The product roadmap moves beyond line-skip toward becoming the **operating system for nightlife venues**: POS, CRM, marketing, ticketing, and analytics in one platform.

4. **Geographic expansion** — 150+ cities today; the $200M valuation round is earmarked for expansion into new markets and deeper penetration in existing ones.

5. **$100B TAM claim** — LineLeap frames the nightlife and entertainment industry as a $100 billion market and positions itself as the mobile transaction layer for that entire vertical.
