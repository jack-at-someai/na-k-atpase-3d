## Company Position

Show Circuit Online Sales, LLC (est. 2015) is the **leading multi-species challenger** in the online livestock auction market. Founded by Dave Guyer (25+ year cattle industry veteran, Guyer Cattle Company) and Roland Schumaker (founder of The Show Circuit Magazine in 1990), SCO covers **cattle, sheep, goats, pigs, and equine** on a single platform — the broadest species coverage of any dedicated livestock auction site.

The business model is **platform + media integration** — the auction platform is powered by a sister publication (The Show Circuit Magazine, 50,000+ reach) that provides a built-in content-commerce flywheel no competitor has. Custom-built by AxiaTP (Indianapolis), the platform features proxy bidding, racehorse-style closing, watch lists with color-coded bid status, and self-service seller tools.

40,000+ total auctions conducted. 10,000+ registered users. 23,000 Instagram followers. ~25 team members across office staff, magazine, and field representatives covering cattle, sheep/goat, and swine divisions in 16+ states.

## Revenue Estimation

Show Circuit Online Sales is privately held with no public revenue disclosures. The following estimation uses platform data and industry benchmarks:

### Method 1: Seller Fees (Per-Head Model)
- Seller fee: $10/head flat rate, $750 sale minimum
- ~11,000 sales/year estimated (61 sales in 2 days extrapolated)
- Average 15–20 lots per sale
- 11,000 × 17 avg lots × $10/head = **$1.87M**
- Plus $750 minimums on smaller sales: additional **$200K–$400K**

### Method 2: Payment Processing Margin
- 3.5% credit card fee passed to buyers (likely includes 0.5–1% margin over merchant cost)
- If total GMV is $50M–$100M across all species (conservative for 40K+ auctions)
- 0.5% margin × $75M = **$375K** in processing margin

### Method 3: Magazine & Advertising Revenue
- The Show Circuit Magazine: print ($595/full page) + digital (eBlasts, banners)
- 50,000+ reach, bimonthly (8 issues/year)
- Estimated: $400K–$800K in combined print/digital advertising

### Method 4: Employee-Based Revenue Estimate
- ~25 total staff (office + field reps)
- Revenue per employee in service/tech businesses: $100K–$200K
- 25 × $150K = **$3.75M**

### Consolidated Estimate

| Scenario | Annual Revenue | Basis |
|----------|---------------|-------|
| Conservative | $2M | Auction fees + processing margin |
| Base Case | $3.5M | Full platform + magazine + digital |
| Aggressive | $5M | All revenue streams at growth trajectory |

**Working estimate: $2.5M–$4M annual revenue.** High growth trajectory — platform went from 4,600 users and 42K bids (2015) to 10K+ users and 220K+ bids (2017), with page views growing 166% year over year. The multi-species model provides diversification that single-species platforms lack.

## Technology Landscape

### SCO's Current Stack
- Custom web application by AxiaTP (Indianapolis)
- Google Analytics (G-3DS9N0DS8H) + Microsoft Application Insights
- CKEditor for content management
- Slick Carousel for lot images
- Mobile-responsive web + Android app (very low app adoption — 18 downloads)
- Text/SMS notifications for bidders
- Multi-language verification (10 languages)
- Credit card, eCheck, check/money order payment

### Industry Technology Trends
- **Livestreaming** integration standard at top tier (CCI.Live, DVAuction, SaleRing.Live)
- **Mobile bidding** dominant — 50%+ of traffic from mobile
- **AI in livestock** emerging — computer vision, precision feeding, genetic selection tools
- **STAGES** genetic evaluation (NSR) — BLUP-based EPDs, not connected to sale platforms
- **StockLink** (2025) — first dedicated livestock social media app, response to mainstream platforms restricting animal sales

### What Doesn't Exist (Sounder Opportunity)
- **Cross-platform sale analytics** — no system compares performance across SCO, ShowPig.com, CCI.Live
- **Pedigree integration** — sale platforms don't connect to registry databases
- **Unified buyer/seller graph** — bidder behavior across platforms is invisible
- **Cross-species breeder intelligence** — a seller using SCO for cattle AND sheep gets no cross-species analytics
- **Predictive pricing** — no platform offers data-driven sale timing or pricing recommendations

## Sounder Thesis for SC Online Sales

**"SC Online Sales is the only true multi-species livestock auction platform — and their data spans cattle, sheep, goats, pigs, and equine with zero cross-species intelligence."**

The Wendt Group dominates show pigs. CCI.Live dominates seedstock cattle. DVAuction dominates infrastructure. SC Online Sales sits in the most interesting position — the multi-species middle. But their platform was built by an external IT firm (AxiaTP), not internal engineers. Their technology advantage is purchasing power, not proprietary engineering.

Sounder's Charlotte substrate gives SCO what they can't build themselves:
- **Cross-species seller intelligence** — a breeder who sells cattle AND sheep on SCO gets unified analytics
- **Multi-division coordination** — cattle, sheep/goat, and swine divisions operating on a shared knowledge graph
- **Buyer behavior analytics** — which bidders cross species boundaries, what drives bid escalation
- **Competitive positioning** — how SCO performance compares to ShowPig.com and CCI.Live
- **The Show Circuit integration** — Charlotte connects magazine readership to auction behavior

The strategic angle: Sounder is already partnering with the Wendt Group (the pig incumbent). Adding SC Online Sales gives Sounder coverage of the **entire multi-species online auction landscape**. ShowPig.com data + SCO data + NSR registry data = the most complete picture of the U.S. show livestock market ever assembled.

Torie Schwartz (SCO's sheep admin) is former NSR/NJSA staff. That's a direct bridge between SCO and Sounder's existing NSR relationship.
