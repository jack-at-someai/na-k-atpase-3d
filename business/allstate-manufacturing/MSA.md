## SomeAI × All State Manufacturing Co., Inc.

---

**MANAGED SERVICE AGREEMENT**

This Managed Service Agreement ("Agreement") is entered into as of **April 1, 2026** ("Effective Date") by and between:

**SomeAI Research Lab**, a division of Richard Enterprises ("Provider"), with principal offices at Paris, Illinois

and

**All State Manufacturing Co., Inc.** ("Client"), with principal offices at 4024 2nd Parkway, Terre Haute, Indiana 47804

collectively referred to as the "Parties."

---

## 1. DEFINITIONS

**1.1 "Charlotte OS"** means the Provider's proprietary operational intelligence substrate, including all graph infrastructure, signal processing pipelines, protocol engines, and derived analytics capabilities.

**1.2 "Substrate"** means the deployed instance of Charlotte OS configured for the Client's operational domain, including all nodes, edges, metrics, signals, and protocols specific to the Client's manufacturing, sales, and service operations.

**1.3 "Signal History"** means the append-only record of all observations, measurements, and events ingested into the Client's Substrate over time.

**1.4 "Protocols"** means the decision frameworks, expected trajectories, drift thresholds, and evaluation criteria configured within the Substrate to generate operational intelligence.

**1.5 "Deliverables"** means the analytics reports, drift alerts, trajectory analyses, digital assets, and operational intelligence outputs produced by the Provider and delivered to the Client.

**1.6 "Domain Data"** means the raw operational records, measurements, customer information, order histories, product specifications, and observations provided by the Client for ingestion into the Substrate.

---

## 2. SCOPE OF SERVICES

**2.1 Service Model.** This is a managed service engagement. The Provider deploys, operates, and maintains the Substrate on behalf of the Client. The Client does not access, configure, or operate the Substrate directly. The Client receives Deliverables — not platform access.

**2.2 Phase 1 — Foundation (Months 1–6).** During the Foundation Phase, the Provider will deploy:

- (a) **Brand identity and design system** — Complete visual identity, color system, typography, and brand guidelines for consistent presentation across all channels
- (b) **Custom website** — Replacement of the Client's existing Wix-hosted website with a purpose-built, search-optimized site featuring structured product catalog, specification sheets, and contact infrastructure
- (c) **Product catalog digitization** — All current SKUs documented with dimensions, specifications, materials, and photography guidance in a structured, searchable format
- (d) **Domain discovery and operational walkthrough** — On-site visit to the Client's Terre Haute facility to document manufacturing processes, team roles, order flow, and customer relationships
- (e) **Knowledge graph seeding** — Initial Substrate deployment with entity nodes (products, employees, customers, competitors, suppliers), relationship edges, and historical data import
- (f) **Basic CRM deployment** — Customer accounts modeled as NODEs with order history, contact information, and relationship tracking
- (g) **Social media infrastructure** — Multi-platform presence beyond the Client's existing Facebook page
- (h) **Competitive intelligence baseline** — Initial mapping of the Client's competitive landscape within the micro market fixture industry

**2.3 Phase 2 — Operations (Months 7–24).** Following the Foundation Phase, the Provider will expand to:

- (a) **Order tracking SIGNAL stream** — Real-time signal pipeline tracking each order from placement through fabrication, powder coating, assembly, quality inspection, and shipment
- (b) **Inventory METRIC system** — Digital tracking of raw materials (sheet steel, stainless steel, powder coat supplies), work-in-progress, and finished goods
- (c) **Manufacturing dashboard** — Operational intelligence covering production throughput, lead times, defect rates, and capacity utilization
- (d) **Customer lifecycle graph** — Full relationship intelligence: acquisition source, order frequency, average order value, product preferences, lifetime value
- (e) **Competitive intelligence feed** — Ongoing monitoring of competitor activity, pricing, product launches, and trade show presence
- (f) **Weekly analytics delivery** — Operational intelligence reports covering order pipeline, production status, and customer activity
- (g) **Protocol management** — Quality inspection protocols, powder coat cure verification, assembly sequence validation, and warranty tracking
- (h) **Drift alerts** — Notification when monitored metrics deviate from expected trajectories (lead time creep, order volume decline, material cost spikes)
- (i) **Quarterly on-site review** — In-person operational review at the Client's facility with the Client's designated contact(s)
