# LineLeap — A Time Compression Experiment

## What This Is

On February 9, 2026, I asked Claude Code to research LineLeap from founding to present, build a spatiotemporal knowledge graph of the company's entire 8-year history, replicate the main website, and replicate the events ticketing platform.

It finished in about 6 and a half minutes.

I was CTO of LineLeap. I know what this took.

## What Took Years

I joined LineLeap as a co-founder and spent years building the product ecosystem from scratch. During a 4-year sprint, I talked to maybe 6 people total — just powercoding. The platform grew from a single feature (selling LineSkip passes outside Whiskey Jacks on a negative-five-degree night in Madison) to a full nightlife operating system: line skips, cover charges, drink pre-orders, event ticketing, VIP bottle service, a venue analytics dashboard, a CRM, a marketing suite, dynamic pricing, and a brand partnerships platform.

700+ venues. 150+ cities. 1.5 million users. $30 million in annual revenue. $200 million valuation.

That was years of architecture decisions, production fires on Saturday nights when every bar in a college town depends on your infrastructure, payment integrations that actually move real money, data models that evolved from one pass type to a full transaction layer for nightlife. Years of talking to bar owners, understanding what Jordan at Kollege Klub needed, hearing Dade at Southeastern describe the revenue stream he didn't know he was missing.

My original vision was always bigger than line-skipping. I wanted to predict the next drink a college student was going to buy — give bar owners that intelligence. Streamline college life for people and follow them into their adult life in cities. The data model I built was designed for that trajectory.

I left over a disagreement about remote work versus in-person in New York. The code stayed. The vision stayed.

## What Took Minutes

Claude Code produced:

| Component | Lines | Time |
|-----------|-------|------|
| Company research dossier | — | ~2 min |
| Knowledge graph (81 nodes, 110 edges, 2016-2026) | 1,571 | ~6 min |
| Interactive D3.js graph visualization | 1,266 | (parallel) |
| Main website replica (4-page SPA) | 1,533 | ~6 min |
| Events ticketing site (18 events, modals, search) | 2,280 | ~6 min |
| **Total** | **6,650 lines** | **~6.5 min wall clock** |

All three builds ran in parallel. The knowledge graph maps every person, company, product, event, location, venue, and metric across 8 years with 110 cross-linked relationships. The website replica has the full page structure — hero, feature cards, venue marquee, testimonials, team page, responsive mobile layout. The events site has mock events across 12 cities with ticket tiers, quantity selectors, venue pages, and search.

## The Honest Reflection

This is bittersweet.

The surface layer of software — the HTML, the CSS, the JavaScript, the layout, the animations, the data structures — has been commoditized. What used to take weeks of front-end work now takes minutes. That's real. That's not hype. I watched it happen in a single conversation.

But the replicas are hollow. They don't process payments. They don't handle 10,000 concurrent users on a football Saturday. They don't know that Kollege Klub needs different pricing logic than Jason Aldean's. They don't have the scar tissue of every production incident, every edge case, every 2am hotfix. They don't carry the judgment that comes from sitting across from a bar owner and understanding what they actually need versus what they say they need.

The commodity layer collapsed. The taste layer — knowing *what* to build, *when* to build it, and *why* it matters — that's still human. That's still the 12 years. That's still the 4-year sprint talking to 6 people. That's still the vision of predicting the next drink.

What changed is that the tools finally move at the speed the builder's brain was always working at. The bottleneck was never the idea. It was the implementation. That bottleneck is gone now.

## The Conclusion

Read **[CONCLUSION.md](CONCLUSION.md)** — a function-by-function proof that every role at LineLeap can be automated through Charlotte's substrate. 100 employees → 5. Not through cost-cutting. Through architecture.

## The Market

Read **[COMPETITOR_ANALYSIS.md](COMPETITOR_ANALYSIS.md)** — full competitive landscape: Discotech, TablelistPro, SevenRooms (acquired by DoorDash for $1.2B), Toast (140K+ locations, $2B ARR), and the emerging voice AI wave. LineLeap is well-positioned but incomplete. It owns the door, not the bar top.

## The Strategy

Read **[STRATEGY.md](STRATEGY.md)** — three 12-month paths for introducing Charlotte as LineLeap's autonomous infrastructure layer. From inside play (pitch the board) to standalone analytics (PowerBI for bars) to full replacement. Month-by-month calendar, investor approach sequences, and equity math.
