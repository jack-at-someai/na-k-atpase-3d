## Professional Experience

### Delphi / Aptiv — Autonomous Vehicles (6 years)

**Role:** Advanced Engineering Team

**Public Presentations:**
- Google I/O (2016-2017)
- CES (2016-2017)

Presented autonomous vehicle technology on the world's largest stages for consumer and developer audiences. Part of the engineering team building the systems that would later inform the forensic reconstruction work and signal-based architecture thinking.

**Connection to Charlotte:**
The autonomous vehicle work required time-indexed signals from vehicle subsystems, immutable data for legal/forensic contexts, and explainability under adversarial scrutiny. These requirements directly influenced the FINN principle (signals over attributes) and the emphasis on explanation as evidence-backed narration.

### LineLeap — VP of Engineering

Joined during the scaling phase after Y Combinator. Managed engineering operations as the platform grew from startup to $100M+ exit.

**Responsibilities:**
- Engineering team leadership
- Technical operations at scale
- Platform reliability across 100+ cities, 1,000,000+ users

### Richard Enterprises — Internal Operations

Now manages internal company accounting and operational structure for the family enterprise spanning Jack (R&D/Engineering), Joseph (Operations), and their father (Strategy/Acquisitions)

## Origin Story: Dave Genger

Dave Genger, a science teacher at Lake Forest Country Day School, influenced both Richard brothers:
- **Jack** → Robotics → AI → Systems Architecture
- **Joseph** → Insects → Animals → Biological Systems

These parallel trajectories, seeded by the same teacher, reconverged in:
1. The agricultural/biological systems work (Sounder)
2. The naming of SomeAI ("Some Animal Intelligence")
3. The co-founding of the research lab

Dave Genger died three months after Jack graduated middle school (~2010). His influence persists as a standing wave across both brothers' careers—a living example of Paper 11's harmonic resonance and posthumous knowledge transfer.

## Role in SomeAI

**Co-Founder** and **Co-Author** on the 12-paper research suite.

Brings operational discipline, automotive engineering rigor, and the bridge between technical systems and business structure. The connection between Jack's R&D vision and the practical deployment of Charlotte infrastructure.

## The Three-Generation Architecture

Richard Enterprises demonstrates the "time fold speedup" described in Paper 11:

| Generation | Role | Domain |
|------------|------|--------|
| Father | Strategy, Acquisitions, CEO Management | Industrial PE, Swarm Coordination |
| Joseph | Operations, Engineering Management | Automotive → Startup Scale |
| Jack | R&D, Architecture, Formalization | AI, Knowledge Graphs, Infrastructure |

Three generations working in the same company, on the same infrastructure, with shared metrics and protocols. The resonance conditions are fully satisfied:
- **Frequency match:** Shared metrics across all three
- **Phase alignment:** Shared operational cadence
- **Medium presence:** Daily co-location and collaboration
