## The Teacher

Dave Genger was not an advisor. He was not a research mentor. He was not an academic influence in the traditional sense. He was a **middle school science teacher** who died three months after Jack graduated eighth grade.

He taught science at Lake Forest Country Day School — a small independent school on the North Shore of Chicago. He was the kind of teacher who did not just teach subjects. He taught kids to see. He introduced Jack to robotics. He introduced Joseph to insects and animals. Two brothers, two tracks, one teacher.

The Rio Grande School Board, selecting him unanimously as their next head of school, described him as having:

> "a quick and curious mind, strong character, and excellent work ethic"

> "a warm, straightforward, and outgoing manner"

> "a genuine love of children"

> "an exceptionally good listener"

His own philosophy of leadership:

> "The root word 'minist-' means 'in service to.' That informs my view."

He was about to leave Illinois for Santa Fe. He died in his sleep on June 16, 2010. He was 47.

## What He Built at LFCDS

Dave Genger built the science culture at Lake Forest Country Day School. As Chair of the Science Department and later Head of Upper School, he established the conditions under which curiosity was the primary metric and the natural world was the primary text.

Under his influence:
- LEGO robotics competitions became a signature activity (LFCDS teams have qualified for FLL State Tournament 14+ consecutive years)
- Science was taught as observation and engagement, not memorization
- Students connected with real scientists, real specimens, real systems
- The boundary between "science class" and "the world" was intentionally dissolved

He championed diversity initiatives. He contributed to the school's strategic plan. He implemented reforms in teaching and learning. But the thing that mattered — the thing that persisted — was the orientation. He taught kids to look at the world and ask: what is this? How does it work? What does it want to do?

## The Two Tracks

Dave Genger seeded two parallel trajectories in the Richard brothers:

| Brother | Genger's Influence | Trajectory | Destination |
|---------|-------------------|------------|-------------|
| **Jack** | Robotics, systems, building | Robotics → Computer Science → AI → Knowledge Graphs → Charlotte | Infrastructure for observable reality |
| **Joseph** | Insects, animals, biology | Animals → Biology → Automotive Engineering → Agricultural Systems → Sounder | Biological systems, livestock, co-founding SomeAI |

These tracks diverged for a decade. Jack went to Rose-Hulman for computer science. Joseph went into engineering and automotive. They reconverged in:

1. **Sounder** — agricultural/biological systems work combining Jack's graph architecture with Joseph's biological domain knowledge
2. **SomeAI** — the research lab, co-founded by both brothers
3. **The name itself** — "Some Animal Intelligence," because artificial isn't artificial if it's human-centric. Humans are animals. The goal is sharing human intelligence with humans, not creating something separate.

The name "SomeAI" is a standing wave between Dave Genger's two tracks. He taught one brother about machines and the other about animals. The lab that carries both traditions forward is named for the overlap.

## The ENDED_ON Date

In Charlotte's architecture, every node has a lifecycle. Some lifecycles are still active — signals still being emitted, metrics still being measured. Some lifecycles have ended. When a lifecycle ends, the node receives a LIFE_END signal. The signal history is sealed. The node becomes immutable ground truth.

Dave Genger's ENDED_ON date is **June 16, 2010**.

His signal history stopped. No new observations. No new measurements. No new interactions.

But his edges remain traversable. His influence did not end when his signals did. The students he taught are still emitting signals on dimensions he established. The LEGO competitions he championed still run. The Scientist-in-Residence Day that bears his name brings working scientists to LFCDS every year — elephants, wolves, cranes, fossils — the same orientation toward the natural world that he embodied.

This is the distinction between **signal cessation** and **influence cessation**. In Charlotte, they are not the same thing. A retired node's signal history persists in the graph. Its edges still connect to active nodes. Its metrics still define the dimensions along which subsequent nodes are measured.

Dave Genger stopped emitting signals in 2010. His frequency is still the carrier wave.

## The Memorial: Scientist-in-Residence Day

In 2011, LFCDS established the **David L. Genger Scientist-in-Residence Day** — an annual event that brings working scientists to the school to engage directly with students.

| Year | Scientist | Domain |
|------|-----------|--------|
| 2015 | Dr. George Archibald, International Crane Foundation | Conservation, wetlands, global ecology |
| 2016 | Sir Iain Douglas-Hamilton | Elephant conservation, wildlife tracking |
| 2017 | Jim & Jamie Dutcher, Living with Wolves | Wolf behavior, pack dynamics, field observation |
| Other years | Field Museum researchers, holography experts, fossil collectors | Various natural sciences |

The program was launched by Mark Arthur (Genger's successor as Science Chair) and Bob Bullard (Assistant Head of School), alongside faculty and parents.

The pattern: the scientists brought to LFCDS are not lecturers. They are **observers of the natural world** — people who spent years watching animals, studying ecosystems, collecting evidence from the field. This is not a coincidence. This is Genger's signal, still shaping the protocol decades after LIFE_END.

## The SomeAI Origin

The name "SomeAI" — **Some Animal Intelligence** — encodes Dave Genger's foundational insight without naming him directly.

The logic:
- "Artificial intelligence" implies something non-human, synthetic, separate
- But humans are animals. Human intelligence is animal intelligence.
- The goal is not to create artificial cognition. The goal is to share *human* intelligence with *humans*.
- Therefore: not "Artificial" Intelligence. **Some Animal** Intelligence.

This naming was influenced by Genger's dual tracks — robotics (machine intelligence) and biology (animal intelligence). The branches converged. The name holds both.

## Connection to Charlotte: Paper 11

Dave Genger is the primary case study for Paper 11 — Harmonic Resonance.

### The Thesis

Knowledge does not die when the knower dies. If the knower's signal history has been absorbed into the trajectories of other nodes — if the frequency has been transmitted — then the pattern persists as a standing wave. The dead teach the living.

### The Evidence

    │
    └── EDGE: RESONATES_WITH → Charlotte (the architecture)
            Time-indexed signals. Append-only history.
            Retired nodes whose influence persists.
            The dead teach the living.
```

Genger has been archived for fifteen years. His signal count is zero since June 2010. But his edge count keeps growing — every student who passes through the Scientist-in-Residence program, every line of Charlotte code that treats time as the primary axis of truth, every time Jack or Joseph traces a decision back to "something I learned in middle school."

### The Resonance Measurement

If you could compute the resonance score between Dave Genger's archived node and the active nodes of the Richard brothers in 2026:

- **Signal-protocol alignment:** High. Both brothers are operating in domains Genger seeded — systems thinking (Jack) and biological systems (Joseph).
- **Temporal consistency:** 16 years and counting. The alignment has not weakened.
- **Phase alignment:** The brothers' trajectories are converging, not diverging — exactly the pattern Genger's dual tracks predicted.
- **Entrenchment:** When either brother deviates from the observation-first, nature-grounded orientation, they self-correct. The frequency is deeply entrained.
- **Harmonic ratio:** Genger's influence operates across timescales — daily (how they approach problems), yearly (what they choose to build), generationally (how they think about knowledge transfer).

By Charlotte's resonance metric, Dave Genger's retired node is among the highest-resonance influences in the entire graph. More resonant than many active nodes.

The dead teach the living. The teacher's frequency still shapes the students' paths — not through instruction, but through the structure of the field he left behind.
