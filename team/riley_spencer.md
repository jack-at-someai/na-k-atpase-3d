## Background

Riley Spencer is a family medicine physician from Paris, Illinois — the same small town that produced Logan McDaniel, Charlotte's namesake and CEO of SumAI. They grew up best friends. While Logan went into biochemical engineering and genetics, Riley went into medicine — the other side of the biological sciences. One builds the computational model of living systems. The other treats them.

Riley's path to medicine was not a straight line. He started at Lincoln Land Community College and MacMurray College in central Illinois, played four years of collegiate basketball, then crossed an ocean to attend Ross University School of Medicine in Barbados. Clinical rotations in Los Angeles, Chicago, and Miami gave him training across the full spectrum of American healthcare — from dense urban systems to the underserved populations he ultimately chose to serve. He selected Fort Wayne's FWMEP specifically for its blend of rural and suburban medicine.

### Career Trajectory

## Training Environment

### Fort Wayne Medical Education Program (FWMEP)

FWMEP is affiliated with Lutheran Hospital in Fort Wayne and offers a community-based family medicine residency. The program emphasizes the full scope of family medicine — outpatient primary care, inpatient medicine, obstetrics, pediatrics, geriatrics, and rural practice.

Riley chose FWMEP for its unique positioning between rural and suburban medicine — the kind of practice environment where a single physician touches every aspect of a patient's health. His wife attended Indiana Tech in Fort Wayne, grounding him in the community long-term.

## SumAI Relevance

### Role: Core Team — Touch Pillar

Family medicine is the broadest medical specialty — it touches every organ system, every age group, every socioeconomic layer. A family physician is the NODE through which the most diverse set of patient SIGNALs flow. Where specialists see one system deeply, a family physician sees the whole patient across time. That longitudinal, whole-person view is exactly Charlotte's model: observe an identity over time, track all signals, detect patterns the specialists miss.

### Charlotte Connection

- **Family medicine IS Charlotte's observation model applied to humans:** One identity (patient) emitting signals (symptoms, vitals, labs, imaging) over time, measured against protocols (standard of care), with metrics (outcomes, disease progression). Riley will practice this model daily.
- **Rural medicine as edge computing:** Rural physicians operate with fewer resources, less specialist access, and broader scope. They must observe more, synthesize faster, and act with less infrastructure — the same challenge Charlotte solves for organizations operating at the edge.
- **The Paris, IL axis:** Riley and Logan McDaniel grew up best friends in Paris, Illinois. Logan builds the computational substrate for modeling living systems (SumAI, Sounder, Charlotte). Riley treats living systems directly. The same small-town friendship that produced Charlotte's namesake also produced the physician who understands why whole-system observation matters — because he does it on humans every day.
- **Ross University path:** Going from central Illinois community college to Caribbean medical school to residency in Fort Wayne is not the prestige-optimized path. It is the path of someone who wanted to be a doctor badly enough to find a way when the conventional pipeline did not open. That persistence under constraint — finding alternative routes to the same destination — is exactly the kind of resourcefulness the lab values.
- **The medical triad:** Riley (family medicine / primary care), Josh Hunt (diagnostic radiology / imaging), and Paul Beinhoff (psychiatry / neuroimaging) form a three-physician team spanning the full observation stack — from the first patient encounter through imaging to the brain itself.
