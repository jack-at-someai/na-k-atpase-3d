## Identity

**Name:** Zachary Cao
**Current Role:** Director of Organizational Intelligence, SomeAI
**Previous Role:** Software Engineer, ServiceNow
**Team Role:** Core Team — Brain Pillar (organizational intelligence, data architecture)

## Background

Zachary is already at SomeAI. That sentence carries weight — in a research lab still assembling its full team, Zachary is one of the people already inside the building. His title, Director of Organizational Intelligence, is not a euphemism or a stretch. It describes exactly what Charlotte provides: making organizations observable and intelligent. Zachary's job is to be the human embodiment of that function while the machine substrate catches up.

His path through Rose-Hulman (Computer Science) into ServiceNow (enterprise workflow automation) into a master's in Engineering Management created a specific kind of engineer — one who understands both the technical architecture of software systems and the organizational architecture of the companies that use them. That dual fluency is rare and precisely what the Brain Pillar requires.

### Career Trajectory

```
Rose-Hulman (CS) --> ServiceNow (Enterprise Workflow) --> Rose-Hulman (M.S. Engineering Management) --> SomeAI (Director of Organizational Intelligence)
```

The return to Rose-Hulman for the Engineering Management master's is the pivot point. It is the moment where a software engineer decided that building systems was not enough — he needed to understand how organizations consume, resist, and adapt to the systems built for them. That insight is the foundation of organizational intelligence.

## Career

### SomeAI — Director of Organizational Intelligence (Current)

Zachary holds one of the defining roles at SomeAI. Organizational intelligence is the discipline of making an organization's structure, behavior, and performance observable and actionable. In Charlotte's terms, it is the act of turning an entire company into a graph of NODEs (people, teams, processes), EDGEs (relationships, dependencies, reporting lines), METRICs (performance measures), SIGNALs (communications, decisions, outputs), and PROTOCOLs (policies, workflows, cultural norms).

This is not analytics. Analytics tells you what happened. Organizational intelligence tells you what your organization is — its actual structure, not its org chart; its actual workflows, not its documented procedures; its actual decision-making patterns, not its stated policies.

### ServiceNow — Software Engineer

Enterprise workflow automation at ServiceNow. ServiceNow is one of the largest enterprise software platforms in the world — its core product is the digitization and automation of organizational workflows: IT service management, HR processes, security operations, customer service. Every ServiceNow implementation is an exercise in mapping an organization's actual processes into a formal system.

This experience is directly relevant to Charlotte's PROTOCOL primitive. A ServiceNow workflow is a behavioral contract: "when this event occurs, route to this person, escalate after this duration, resolve with this action." Charlotte's PROTOCOLs encode the same logic at a more fundamental level — not as a SaaS configuration, but as a substrate-level primitive.

## Rose-Hulman Cluster

Zachary is a double Rose-Hulman graduate — B.S. and M.S. — making him one of the strongest connections in the Rose-Hulman cluster within the SumAI research lab. His continued relationship with the institution through the graduate program means he has visibility into both the undergraduate talent pipeline and the faculty research network.

## SumAI Relevance

### Pillar: Brain (primary)

The Brain Pillar studies cognition, decision-making, organizational intelligence, and the computational substrates that model them. Zachary's assignment to the Brain Pillar is direct — his title is literally "Director of Organizational Intelligence," and his job is to make SomeAI's client organizations observable and intelligent through Charlotte.

The Brain Pillar is where Charlotte's five primitives are applied to the most complex systems we know: organizations made of humans. Unlike a refinery (where sensors have known calibration) or a herd of swine (where pedigrees follow genetic rules), a human organization is a system where the NODEs have agency, the PROTOCOLs are often implicit, and the SIGNALs are ambiguous. Making that system observable requires both technical skill and organizational intuition. Zachary brings both.

### Charlotte Connection

- **Organizational intelligence IS Charlotte's thesis:** Charlotte's core claim is that any domain becomes observable when you model identities emitting signals over time. Zachary's job is to apply that claim to organizations — the most commercially valuable domain. Every client SomeAI onboards is an organization that needs to become observable to itself.
- **ServiceNow background maps to PROTOCOLs:** Every ServiceNow workflow Zachary built or configured was a PROTOCOL — a behavioral contract defining expected sequences of actions with escalation rules and resolution criteria. Charlotte's PROTOCOL primitive formalizes this at the substrate level.
- **Engineering Management as meta-organizational intelligence:** Zachary's M.S. in Engineering Management means he has studied, formally, how to manage the process of building systems. This meta-level awareness — understanding not just the system but the organization building the system — is essential for the Brain Pillar's research agenda.
- **Already inside the building:** Zachary is not a prospective team member. He is already at SomeAI, already doing the work, already applying Charlotte's principles to real client engagements. His profile is documentation of an existing function, not a recruitment pitch.
