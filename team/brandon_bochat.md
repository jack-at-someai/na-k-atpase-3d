## Identity

**Name:** Brandon Bochat
**Current Role:** Senior Development Engineer, Zimmer Biomet (orthopedic medical devices)
**Team Role:** Core Team — Touch Pillar (biomedical engineering, 3D printing, orthopedic implants, biomechanics)
**Cluster:** Rose-Hulman
**Brother:** Corey Bochat (also on team — the Bochat brothers)

## Background

Brandon engineers the objects that go inside the human body. Orthopedic implants — hips, knees, shoulders, spinal hardware — are among the most demanding engineered artifacts in existence. They must bear millions of load cycles, interface with living bone tissue, resist corrosion in a saline biological environment, and be manufactured to tolerances that satisfy the FDA. Brandon's career has been spent at this intersection of advanced manufacturing and human biology, with a particular depth in additive manufacturing (3D printing) for medical devices.

### Career Trajectory

```
Rose-Hulman (Biomedical Engineering) → Catalent Pharma Sciences → Tangible Solutions (Lead Additive Manufacturing Engineer) → Zimmer Biomet (Senior Development Engineer)
```

The arc moves from pharmaceutical manufacturing through 3D-printed medical implants to one of the world's largest orthopedic device companies. Each step deepened the same core competency: building physical objects that must perform inside the human body, under FDA oversight, with zero tolerance for failure.

## Education

| Institution | Degree | Notes |
|-------------|--------|-------|
| Rose-Hulman Institute of Technology | B.S. Biomedical Engineering | Biomechanics concentration. Rose-Hulman cluster member. |

Biomedical engineering with a biomechanics concentration is the most mechanically rigorous track within BME — focused on forces, materials, and structural behavior in biological systems. This is not the software or imaging side of biomedical engineering. This is the side that understands how bone breaks, how implants bear load, and how the human musculoskeletal system transmits force.

## Professional Experience

### Zimmer Biomet — Senior Development Engineer

Zimmer Biomet is one of the global leaders in orthopedic medical devices — hip and knee replacements, spinal implants, surgical instruments, and robotic-assisted surgery platforms. As a Senior Development Engineer, Brandon works on:

| Domain | Detail |
|--------|--------|
| **Orthopedic Implant Design** | Component design for joint replacement and musculoskeletal devices |
| **Development Engineering** | Taking concepts from design through verification, validation, and production |
| **FDA Quality Systems** | Design controls, risk management, regulatory compliance (21 CFR 820) |
| **Advanced Materials** | Titanium, cobalt-chrome, UHMWPE, porous structures for osseointegration |

### Tangible Solutions — Lead Additive Manufacturing Engineer

Lead engineer for 3D-printed medical implants at Tangible Solutions, an FDA-regulated additive manufacturing facility. This is the cutting edge of implant manufacturing — building patient-specific and porous-structured implants layer by layer from metal powder.

| Skill | Detail |
|-------|--------|
| **Metal 3D Printing** | Laser powder bed fusion (LPBF) for titanium and cobalt-chrome implants |
| **FDA-Regulated Manufacturing** | Process validation, quality systems, traceability for implantable devices |
| **Lead Engineer** | Technical leadership of the additive manufacturing engineering function |
| **Porous Structures** | Lattice and trabecular designs that promote bone ingrowth |

### Catalent Pharma Sciences — Pharmaceutical Manufacturing

Early career in pharmaceutical manufacturing — process engineering in a regulated environment. The FDA quality system mindset was established here before Brandon moved into medical devices.

## The Bochat Brothers

Brandon and his brother **Corey Bochat** are both on the SumAI team — both Rose-Hulman graduates, both engineers, operating in adjacent but distinct domains. Brandon builds the things that go inside the body (orthopedic implants). Corey builds the systems that watch the world (defense sensors and ISR platforms). Together they span the Touch and Sight pillars — one engineering at the scale of human tissue, the other engineering at the scale of theater-wide surveillance.

The brother pair is a research lab asset. They share mental models, vocabulary, and a trust depth that cannot be replicated by hiring strangers. When Charlotte needs to bridge the gap between biomedical sensing and defense-grade observation systems, the Bochat brothers are the EDGE.

## SumAI Relevance

### Pillar: Touch (primary)

Brandon is a Touch Pillar engineer at the most literal level possible. Orthopedic implants are designed interfaces between human tissue and engineered material — the boundary where the body touches the machine. Every implant surface, every porous lattice designed for bone ingrowth, every bearing surface in a hip replacement is engineered Touch.

### Charlotte Connection

- **Implants as tissue-material interfaces:** Every implant is a designed interface between human tissue and engineered material — the literal boundary of Touch. The implant is a NODE embedded in a biological system. The forces it transmits are SIGNALs. The bone ingrowth it promotes is a METRIC of integration success.
- **Biomechanical signal processing:** Biomechanical analysis is signal processing of force, strain, and motion. Gait analysis, joint loading, implant fatigue — these are all time-series signals that Charlotte's substrate is built to capture. Every step a patient takes after joint replacement generates data that Charlotte can model.
- **3D printing as spatial instantiation:** 3D printing creates spatial structures from digital models — the physical instantiation of Charlotte's spatial substrate. A porous titanium lattice designed for osseointegration is a spatial structure defined by coordinates and material properties. The digital twin of that implant lives naturally in Charlotte's spatial primitives.
- **FDA quality as PROTOCOL:** FDA design controls are behavioral contracts — intended use, design inputs, design outputs, verification, validation. This is Charlotte's PROTOCOL primitive in regulatory form. Expected performance is specified. Actual performance is tested. Divergence triggers corrective action.
