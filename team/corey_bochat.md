## Identity

**Name:** Corey Bochat
**Current Role:** Senior Systems Engineer, SAIC (Science Applications International Corporation)
**Team Role:** Core Team — Sound/Sight Pillar (defense sensors, military systems engineering, expeditionary ISR)
**Cluster:** Rose-Hulman
**Brother:** Brandon Bochat (also on team — the Bochat brothers)

## Background

Corey has spent his career building and sustaining the sensor systems that the U.S. military uses to watch the world. From expeditionary surveillance towers in combat zones to model-based systems engineering at one of the largest defense contractors in the country, his work is observation infrastructure — how do you put sensors in a place, keep them running, and make sense of what they see? This is Charlotte's thesis expressed in military hardware.

### Career Trajectory

```
Rose-Hulman → Sage Products / Stryker (Medical Devices, Intern) → Naval Surface Warfare Center, Crane (6 years) → SAIC (Senior Systems Engineer)
```

The arc moves from a medical device internship through six years of hands-on defense engineering at one of the Navy's premier weapons and sensor facilities, then into senior systems engineering at a major defense integrator. The through-line is systems thinking applied to observation platforms — how to specify, build, test, and sustain the systems that watch, listen, and report.

## Professional Experience

### SAIC — Senior Systems Engineer

SAIC (Science Applications International Corporation) is a $7B+ defense and government services contractor providing systems engineering, IT modernization, and mission support across the Department of Defense and intelligence community. As a Senior Systems Engineer, Corey operates at the system-of-systems level — integrating hardware, software, and operational requirements into fielded military capabilities.

| Domain | Detail |
|--------|--------|
| **Systems Engineering** | Requirements, architecture, integration, and verification for defense programs |
| **Model-Based Systems Engineering (MBSE)** | SysML/UML modeling of system architectures, behavior, and requirements |
| **Defense Programs** | DoD acquisition lifecycle, milestone reviews, technical authority |

### Naval Surface Warfare Center (NSWC Crane) — 6 Years

NSWC Crane in Crane, Indiana is one of the Navy's most important shore commands — a weapons and sensor center of excellence spanning electronic warfare, special missions, and expeditionary systems. Corey spent six years there, rising to Lead Sustainment Engineer.

#### USMC G-BOSS Program (Ground-Based Operational Surveillance System)

The signature program. **G-BOSS** is an expeditionary sensor tower system deployed by the United States Marine Corps — a mobile, rapidly deployable platform that carries cameras, radar, and other sensors on a telescoping mast to provide persistent surveillance of an area of operations.

| G-BOSS Detail | Description |
|---------------|-------------|
| **What it is** | A ground-based observation system — cameras and sensors on towers watching an area and reporting what they see |
| **Who uses it** | USMC ground forces in expeditionary and combat environments |
| **How it deploys** | Rapidly mobile, telescope mast, can be operational in hours |
| **What it does** | Persistent ISR (Intelligence, Surveillance, Reconnaissance) — watches a spatial field and reports observations |

This is Charlotte. G-BOSS is literally a ground-based observation system — NODEs (sensor platforms) emitting SIGNALs (observations) in a spatial field. Corey did not just work on this system. He was the Lead Sustainment Engineer — responsible for keeping the observation infrastructure operational in the field.

#### Additional NSWC Crane Experience

| Domain | Detail |
|--------|--------|
| **Lead Sustainment Engineer** | Technical lead for maintaining fielded sensor and weapons systems |
| **MIL-STD Testing** | Environmental qualification testing per military standards (MIL-STD-810, etc.) |
| **Environmental Qualification** | Shock, vibration, temperature, humidity, altitude — proving systems survive real-world conditions |
| **Model-Based Systems Engineering** | MBSE adoption and implementation at the warfare center level |

### Sage Products / Stryker — Medical Devices (Intern)

Early career internship in medical devices at Sage Products (now part of Stryker). The medical device connection mirrors his brother Brandon's career in orthopedic implants — both Bochat brothers touched the medical device world before diverging into their respective domains.

## The Bochat Brothers

Corey and his brother **Brandon Bochat** are both on the SumAI team — both Rose-Hulman graduates, both engineers, operating in adjacent but distinct domains. Corey builds the systems that watch the world (defense sensors and ISR platforms). Brandon builds the things that go inside the body (orthopedic implants). Together they span the Sight and Touch pillars — one engineering at the scale of theater-wide surveillance, the other engineering at the scale of human tissue.

The brother pair creates a natural bridge between defense-grade observation systems and biomedical sensing. When Charlotte needs to understand how military ISR architecture maps to medical monitoring, the Bochat brothers are the translation layer.

## SumAI Relevance

### Pillar: Sound/Sight (primary)

Corey sits at the intersection of Sound and Sight because military ISR is inherently multi-modal. G-BOSS towers carry cameras (Sight) and can integrate acoustic sensors and radar (Sound). Defense systems engineering at the NSWC Crane and SAIC level means specifying, integrating, and sustaining sensor packages that observe across multiple modalities simultaneously.

### Charlotte Connection

- **G-BOSS is Charlotte's military ancestor:** G-BOSS is literally a ground-based observation system — cameras and sensors on towers watching an area and reporting what they see. That IS Charlotte's thesis: NODEs (sensor platforms) emitting SIGNALs (observations) in a spatial field. Corey engineered the military version of what Charlotte does for any domain. The difference is that Charlotte generalizes the pattern — any domain, any sensor, any spatial field — while G-BOSS was purpose-built for USMC expeditionary surveillance.
- **MBSE maps to Charlotte's formal specification:** Corey's Model-Based Systems Engineering background maps directly to Charlotte's formal specification approach. MBSE uses structured models (SysML) to define system architecture, behavior, and requirements. Charlotte uses five primitives (NODE, EDGE, METRIC, SIGNAL, PROTOCOL) to define observable reality. Both are formal languages for describing systems — one from the defense acquisition world, one from first principles.
- **MIL-STD as PROTOCOL:** Military standard testing is the ultimate expression of Charlotte's PROTOCOL primitive. MIL-STD-810 defines expected environmental conditions (temperature, shock, vibration) and tests whether actual hardware performance meets the specification. Expected vs actual, with formal pass/fail criteria. This is PROTOCOL.
- **Sustainment as temporal observation:** As Lead Sustainment Engineer, Corey's job was to keep observation systems working over time — monitoring health, predicting failures, scheduling maintenance. This is Charlotte's temporal substrate applied to the systems themselves. The sensor platform becomes both the observer and the observed.
