## Background

Ethan is an engineer who has spent his career inside the machines that move people — diesel engines, powertrains, and now the brake systems that stop them. The throughline is mechanical systems under stress: how forces propagate through physical structures, how tolerances are managed at scale, and how the interface between machine and environment determines safety. Braking is the purest expression of this — the moment where every variable in a vehicle's dynamics converges into a single critical function.

### Career Trajectory

```
Honda (Powertrain) → Cummins (Diesel Engines) → Ford Motor Company (Core Brake Engineering)
```

Each step moved closer to the critical interface. Powertrain is the generation of force. Diesel engines are the thermodynamic core. Brake engineering is the controlled dissipation of that force — the system that decides whether the physics work out in the driver's favor. Six years at Ford in chassis systems and brake design have given Ethan deep fluency in vehicle dynamics, safety-critical systems, and the engineering rigor required when failure means lives.

## Education

| Institution | Degree | Notes |
|-------------|--------|-------|
| Rose-Hulman Institute of Technology | B.S. Mechanical Engineering | Rose-Hulman cluster member |
| Purdue University | M.S. Interdisciplinary Engineering | In progress |

The jump from Rose-Hulman to Purdue's interdisciplinary engineering program is telling. Interdisciplinary engineering at the master's level means Ethan is deliberately broadening beyond a single mechanical domain — systems thinking across disciplines, which maps directly to Charlotte's cross-domain substrate philosophy.

## Professional Experience

### Ford Motor Company — Core Brake Engineer (6+ years)

Chassis systems, brake design, and vehicle dynamics at one of the world's largest automotive OEMs. Core brake engineering at Ford means:

| Domain | Detail |
|--------|--------|
| **Brake System Design** | Component selection, system architecture, thermal management |
| **Vehicle Dynamics** | How braking forces interact with suspension, steering, and tire contact patches |
| **Chassis Systems** | Integration of brake, suspension, and steering into a unified dynamic system |
| **Safety-Critical Engineering** | Design verification, failure mode analysis, regulatory compliance |
| **Systems Engineering** | Ford's rigorous V-model development process for safety systems |

### Honda — Powertrain Engineering

Powertrain development — the force generation side of the equation. Understanding how engines produce torque and how that torque reaches the wheels.

### Cummins — Diesel Engine Engineering

Diesel engine development at one of the world's premier engine manufacturers. High-output, high-reliability powerplants where thermodynamic efficiency and mechanical durability are non-negotiable.

## Mayo Clinic Mentorship Program

Participant in the **Mayo Clinic mentorship program** — a connection that bridges engineering and medicine. The overlap between automotive safety engineering and medical device reliability is significant: both are safety-critical domains where failure modes must be anticipated, tested, and designed out. This cross-pollination between automotive and biomedical thinking adds depth to Ethan's systems perspective.

## SumAI Relevance

### Pillar: Touch (primary)

Ethan is a Touch Pillar engineer in the most literal sense. Brake engineering is the study of how physical forces are transmitted, modulated, and controlled at the interface between machine and environment. The brake pedal is a haptic interface. The tire contact patch is where the vehicle touches the earth. Vehicle dynamics is the real-time physics of that contact.

### Charlotte Connection

- **Real-time signal processing:** Vehicle dynamics is real-time signal processing at its core. Every brake application is a SIGNAL — pressure, deceleration, temperature, wheel speed — captured across time. Every chassis component is a NODE in a connected system. Every interaction between tire and road is a METRIC that Charlotte can observe and model.
- **PROTOCOL as safety contract:** Ford's systems engineering approach to vehicle safety mirrors Charlotte's PROTOCOL primitive directly. A braking protocol defines expected behavior (stopping distance, pedal feel, thermal capacity) and measures actual performance against it. When actual diverges from expected, the system intervenes. This is exactly what Charlotte's PROTOCOL primitive does — behavioral contracts that define expected vs actual performance.
- **Multi-domain integration:** Brake engineering at the chassis level requires integrating signals from suspension, steering, tires, ABS, stability control, and driver input. Charlotte's five primitives (NODE, EDGE, METRIC, SIGNAL, PROTOCOL) provide the substrate for modeling exactly this kind of multi-system interaction.
