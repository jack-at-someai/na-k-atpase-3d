## Background

Jet Sethi's career is a demonstration of Charlotte's core thesis: the same signal processing infrastructure applies across domains. He started in quantum physics — studying how photons carry information through nonlinear optical systems and quantum entanglement. Then he carried that signal processing intuition into precision health, where the photons became patients and the optical channels became clinical data pipelines. The math did not change. The infrastructure did not change. Only the domain changed.

### Career Trajectory

```
Rose-Hulman Physics → Miami M.S. Physics (quantum/optics) → Neurological Research → Precision Health Data Science
```

The transition from pure physics research to applied health data science is not a pivot — it is a generalization. Quantum information theory studies how signals propagate, interact, and carry information at the most fundamental level. Precision health studies how biological signals propagate, interact, and carry clinical meaning. The abstraction layer is the same. Jet saw that, and he walked across the bridge.

## Research Background

### Quantum Information & Nonlinear Optics

Graduate research at Miami University focused on quantum information and nonlinear optics — the study of how light behaves in materials where the optical response is not proportional to the input signal. This is signal processing at the photon level:

| Research Area | Description |
|---------------|-------------|
| Quantum Information | How quantum states encode, transmit, and process information |
| Nonlinear Optics | How optical signals interact with materials in non-proportional ways — frequency doubling, parametric amplification, four-wave mixing |
| Quantum Entanglement | Correlated quantum states that carry information across space without classical signal propagation |

These are not abstract theoretical exercises. Quantum information is the foundation of quantum computing, quantum cryptography, and quantum sensing. Nonlinear optics drives laser technology, telecommunications, and medical imaging. The research is fundamental, but the applications are everywhere.

### Neurological & Dementia Research

Before moving into industry, Jet contributed to research on dementia and neurological conditions. Published in scientific journals. This intermediate step — between quantum optics and health data strategy — is where the domain bridge was built. Neurological research requires the same pattern recognition applied to different signals: instead of photon states, neural activity patterns; instead of optical spectra, cognitive assessments over time.

## Current Role

### Senior Director of Product & Strategy — Innovative Precision Health

Leading product strategy at a company focused on data mining and machine learning for patient outcomes. This is the applied end of the signal processing pipeline:

- **Data mining:** Finding patterns in large clinical datasets — the same pattern recognition that drives quantum information theory, applied to patient records instead of photon statistics
- **Machine learning:** Building models that predict patient outcomes from historical signal data
- **Precision health:** Tailoring interventions to individual patients based on their specific signal profiles — the clinical version of Charlotte's per-NODE observation

The title — Senior Director of Product & Strategy — means Jet is not just doing the data science. He is deciding what to build, who to build it for, and how it fits into the broader market. This is strategic thinking layered on top of deep technical capability.

## SumAI Relevance

### Pillar: Brain (primary) — Quantum Physics / Precision Health / Signal Processing

Jet Sethi sits in the Brain Pillar because his work is fundamentally about how information is encoded, transmitted, and decoded — whether by photons or by patients. The Brain Pillar is not just neuroscience. It is the study of information processing at every level, from quantum to cognitive to clinical. Jet's career spans all three.

### Rose-Hulman Cluster

Rose-Hulman Institute of Technology in Terre Haute, Indiana. The Rose-Hulman cluster within SumAI represents a shared institutional culture: small school, engineering-first, rigorous, Midwestern. Rose-Hulman consistently ranks #1 among undergraduate engineering programs that do not offer doctoral degrees. The caliber of technical thinking that comes out of Rose-Hulman is disproportionate to the school's size — and Jet is a product of that system.

### Charlotte Connection

- **Quantum information is signal processing at the most fundamental level.** Photons carry quantum states. Patients carry clinical states. Both are NODEs emitting SIGNALs over time. Charlotte's architecture does not care whether the signal is a photon polarization or a blood pressure reading — the primitives are the same.
- **His career mirrors Charlotte's thesis.** The transition from quantum optics to precision health is proof of concept for Charlotte's domain-agnostic claim. Jet did not need to learn a new kind of signal processing when he moved from physics to health. He needed to learn a new domain vocabulary for the same underlying infrastructure. Charlotte formalizes this — the same five primitives (NODE, EDGE, METRIC, SIGNAL, PROTOCOL) work whether the domain is quantum optics, neurology, or patient outcomes.
- **NODEs emit SIGNALs whether they are photons or patients.** This is the one-line summary of both Jet's career and Charlotte's architecture. The abstraction holds. The math holds. The infrastructure holds. Only the domain label changes.
- **Precision health as Charlotte deployment.** Jet's current work — data mining and ML for patient outcomes — is a natural Charlotte deployment target. Patient records over time are exactly the kind of signal-over-time data Charlotte is designed to observe, measure, and make actionable.
