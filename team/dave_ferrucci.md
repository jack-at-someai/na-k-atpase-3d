## Background

Dave Ferrucci is the inventor of IBM Watson. He initiated the project, built and led a team of 30 AI researchers and software engineers, and drove it from inception in late 2006 to its landmark victory over the best Jeopardy! players of all time in 2011. For this he was named IBM Fellow — the highest technical honor IBM bestows — and VP. He spent 17 years at IBM Research before that win, and five more years after it, pioneering Watson's early applications in healthcare.

Then he left. Not because Watson succeeded, but because of what Watson could not do. The system could retrieve and rank answers at superhuman speed, but it could not explain its reasoning. It could not show the path from question to answer in a way that a human could audit, trust, or learn from. The black box problem — the inability of AI systems to make their reasoning transparent — became Ferrucci's obsession.

At Bridgewater Associates (2012-2021), he directed applied AI with a focus on "explicable models of intelligence." Then in 2015 he founded Elemental Cognition to solve the problem directly: combining large language models with formal reasoning agents so that AI could use ordinary language to solve complex problems while showing its work. EC operated for a decade before Ferrucci moved to Unqork as CTAO in 2025, carrying the same mission — reliable, transparent AI for high-stakes operational problems.

He also serves as Adjunct Professor at Northwestern's Kellogg School of Management. This is where Jack Richard encountered him in 2019, during MSAI's inaugural cohort. Ferrucci gave lectures and participated in industry night at Kellogg, and Jack absorbed his frustration with the black box problem firsthand — the conviction that AI without explicable reasoning is AI that cannot be trusted in high-stakes environments.

## Career

### Unqork — Chief Technology and AI Officer (June 2025 - Present)
Strategic application and integration of reliable AI throughout the Unqork platform.

### Center for Global Enterprise — Managing Director (January 2025 - Present)
Leading researchers in applied AI, helping companies understand, design, and leverage AI solutions across disciplines.

### Elemental Cognition — Founder & CEO (2015-2025)
Founded to solve the black box problem. Combined LLMs with formal reasoning agents to enable ordinary language to reliably solve complex reasoning and optimization challenges — particularly for high-stakes operational problems requiring both linguistic fluency and rigorous mathematical exactitude.

### Bridgewater Associates — Director of Applied AI (2012-2021)
Directed R&D in applied AI with a focus on explicable models of intelligence at the world's largest hedge fund.

### IBM T.J. Watson Research — IBM Fellow, VP (1995-2012)
Built and led the Watson team of 30 AI researchers. Led Watson from inception (2006) through Jeopardy! victory (2011) and early healthcare applications. Prior to Watson, Chief Architect for UIMA (Unstructured Information Management Architecture) — the framework for integrating text, speech, and image analytics that powered Watson and is now an Apache open-source project.

## SumAI Relevance

### Role: Influence — Brain Pillar

Dave Ferrucci would not remember Jack Richard from a lecture hall at Kellogg. But the ideas he communicated — that AI's inability to explain its reasoning is the fundamental barrier to trust, that knowledge representation must be explicit and auditable, that the path from data to conclusion matters as much as the conclusion itself — landed in exactly the mind that would build Charlotte.

### Charlotte Connection

- **The black box problem IS Charlotte's founding thesis:** Ferrucci spent a decade after Watson trying to make AI reasoning transparent. Charlotte's KRF (Knowledge Representation Format) is a different solution to the same problem — instead of making neural networks explain themselves, Charlotte builds the reasoning substrate explicitly. Every fact is a CycL-style assertion. Every relationship is a named EDGE. Every behavioral expectation is a PROTOCOL. The reasoning path is the architecture, not an afterthought.
- **UIMA as architectural precedent:** Before Watson, Ferrucci created the Unstructured Information Management Architecture — a framework for integrating and scaling text, speech, and image analytics. Charlotte's five-primitive architecture (NODE, EDGE, METRIC, SIGNAL, PROTOCOL) serves an analogous purpose: a framework for integrating and scaling observation across any domain. UIMA became Apache open-source. Charlotte's primitives are designed with the same generality.
- **Kellogg × MSAI intersection:** Ferrucci as Adjunct Professor at Kellogg and Jack as a student in MSAI's first cohort (2019) puts them in the same building at the same university at the same time. Northwestern's AI ecosystem — Kris Hammond (CASMI/MSAI director, Jack's mentor), Ken Forbus (qualitative reasoning), and Ferrucci (explicable AI) — formed the intellectual substrate that Charlotte was conceived in.
- **"Explicable models of intelligence":** This phrase from Ferrucci's Bridgewater description could be Charlotte's tagline. Charlotte does not predict. Charlotte observes, represents, and reasons — and every step is visible.
