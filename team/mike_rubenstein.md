## Background

Mike Rubenstein built a thousand-robot swarm that assembles itself into arbitrary shapes without centralized control. Published in *Science* in 2014. That sentence alone puts him in a category that almost no other robotics researcher occupies.

The Kilobots are small, cheap ($14 per unit, 5 minutes to assemble), and individually stupid. Each one can vibrate to slide across a surface, communicate with a few nearby neighbors via infrared, and sense their proximity. No GPS. No global map. No central controller. Given a 2D target shape — a star, a wrench, a letter — 1,024 of them self-organize into it. They detect traffic jams, correct errors, and cooperate to fix misalignment. Intelligence emerges from the interactions between simple agents following local rules. This is not a metaphor for Charlotte's architecture. This IS Charlotte's architecture, implemented in physical hardware.

Rubenstein did the Kilobot work as a postdoctoral researcher in Radhika Nagpal's Self-Organizing Systems Research Group at Harvard. He then joined Northwestern as faculty, where he now leads research in multi-robot systems — control, design, and scaling of robot swarms to hundreds, thousands, and eventually millions of units. His lab works on swarm shape control, modular self-reconfigurable robotics, bio-inspired satellite constellation control, and novel sensing for simple aerial vehicle swarms.

Jack Richard studied under Rubenstein at Northwestern. Of all the mentors and influences assembled in this lab, Rubenstein's impact on Charlotte is second only to Kris Hammond's. Hammond taught Jack how to think about intelligence as narrative — data becoming meaning through structure. Rubenstein taught Jack how to think about intelligence as emergence — meaning arising from the interactions of simple agents following local rules with no central authority. Charlotte is both: structured narrative AND emergent intelligence. The KRF gives structure. The observation loop gives emergence. Rubenstein is why the second half exists.

## Career

### Northwestern University — Faculty (Current)
Lisa Wissner-Slivka and Benjamin Slivka Professor of Computer Science. Associate Professor of Mechanical Engineering. Faculty in the Center for Robotics and Biosystems and the M.S. in Robotics program. Research: control and design of multi-robot systems, scaling from hundreds to millions of robots.

### Harvard University — Postdoctoral Researcher
Self-Organizing Systems Research Group (Radhika Nagpal's lab). Led the Kilobot project — designed, built, and programmed 1,024 robots that self-assemble into complex 2D shapes. Published in *Science* (August 2014): "Programmable self-assembly in a thousand-robot swarm."

## The Kilobots

The Kilobot is a $14 robot that takes 5 minutes to assemble. Each unit has:
- Two vibrating motors for locomotion (sliding on rigid legs)
- Infrared transmitter/receiver (communicate with nearby neighbors, measure proximity)
- No GPS, no global positioning, no central controller

Given a target shape, 1,024 Kilobots self-organize into it using only local communication and simple behavioral rules:
1. Four seed robots mark the origin
2. Others flow around the edge, following the gradient
3. Traffic jams are detected and resolved cooperatively
4. Misaligned robots correct their own positions
5. The shape emerges

This was published as a lead article in *Science*, covered by National Geographic, IEEE Spectrum, Harvard Gazette, and the global press. It remains one of the most cited papers in swarm robotics.

## SumAI Relevance

### Role: Mentor — Brain + Touch Pillar

Mike Rubenstein is the physical proof that Charlotte's thesis works. Charlotte says: put simple agents in a shared substrate, give them local rules and local communication, and intelligence emerges from their interactions. Rubenstein did this with 1,024 physical robots and published it in *Science*. Charlotte does it with NODEs, SIGNALs, and PROTOCOLs in a computational substrate. Same principle. Different medium.

### Charlotte Connection

- **Kilobots ARE Charlotte's primitives in physical form:** Each Kilobot is a NODE. Its infrared messages are SIGNALs. Its proximity measurements are METRICs. The target shape is a PROTOCOL — a behavioral contract defining expected configuration. The EDGEs are the communication links between neighbors. Charlotte's five primitives were not designed to model Kilobots — but they model Kilobots perfectly, because both systems derive from the same insight: intelligence is a property of interactions, not individuals.
- **Self-assembly without central control:** Kilobots have no leader. No master plan is broadcast. Each robot follows local rules based on local information. Charlotte's observation loops work the same way — each NODE emits SIGNALs based on local state, and the global pattern emerges from the aggregate. This is the opposite of top-down enterprise software that tries to control everything from a central dashboard.
- **Error correction as a design principle:** Kilobots detect traffic jams and misalignment and fix them cooperatively. Charlotte's PROTOCOL engine does the same — measuring actual behavior against expected behavior and flagging deviations. Self-correction is built into the architecture, not bolted on.
- **The scale thesis:** Rubenstein's research agenda is explicitly about what happens when you go from 10 robots to 1,000 to 1,000,000. Charlotte's thesis is the same — what happens when you go from observing one organization to ten to a thousand? The algorithms must be local, the communication must be neighbor-based, and the intelligence must emerge. Rubenstein proved this works in hardware. Charlotte extends it to any domain.
- **Northwestern's AI ecosystem — the complete picture:** Ken Forbus (qualitative reasoning — how to represent knowledge), Kris Hammond (narrative AI — how to make data meaningful), Dave Ferrucci (explicable AI — how to make reasoning transparent), Louis Rosenberg (collective intelligence — how groups think), and Mike Rubenstein (swarm robotics — how simple agents self-organize). Five distinct threads of intelligence research, all at or connected to Northwestern, all converging in Jack's thesis. Charlotte is the synthesis.
- **Second only to Kris Hammond:** Jack identifies Rubenstein as his most influential mentor after Hammond. Hammond taught structure. Rubenstein taught emergence. Charlotte is both.
