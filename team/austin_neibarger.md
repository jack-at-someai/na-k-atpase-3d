## Identity

## Background

Austin's trajectory is the most compressed version of what the research lab studies: the human body as signal emitter, the practice as system, the system as software, the software as infrastructure. He went from studying biology to adjusting spines to building the software that runs everything.

### Career Trajectory

```
Biology → Chiropractic → Practice Management → Healthcare Tech → Full-Stack Engineering → SomeAI COO
```

The chiropractor-to-COO pipeline is not a pivot — it is a compression. Every chiropractic adjustment is a signal-response loop: assess the body's state, apply a precise intervention, observe the result. Every practice management decision is the same loop at organizational scale. Austin ran both loops simultaneously before building the software to automate them.

### Why Austin Was Chosen

Jack Richard picked Austin Neibarger for one reason: he is the most convergent thinker Jack knows. Not just in his own work — Austin can take a swarm of people operating at different levels and get them all moving in the same direction. He is a raid leader in World of Warcraft who plays with everyone from newbies to elite players and gauges himself to each, which is exactly the organizational intelligence SomeAI needs at its core.

The co-founders exist on a spectrum from divergence to convergence. Jack is the most divergent — the chaotic creative force, bull-headed, constantly missing timelines because the vision is the entire vision. Austin is the opposite end: execute, execute, execute. He is the timekeeper, the internal operations engine, the person who breaks Jack's back and fixes Jack's back at the same time. He meets Jack at the line and accepts him where others would roll over. He makes up for Jack's weaknesses.

The chiropractic-to-COO path is also extreme metacognition in action. Most people do not leave a clinical doctorate to teach themselves full-stack development and then run operations for a research company. That requires the ability to observe your own learning process, identify what is missing, and close the gap — which is exactly what a COO does for an organization.

### NoHo Chiropractic — NYC

Ran the entire operation: EHR systems, employee training, accounting, billing, office space design. This was not clinical work with a side of management — it was full organizational systems engineering with a clinical foundation.

### Form + Function LLC — Healthcare Tech

Founded a consultancy providing individualized solutions for practice management, medical billing, patient education, and employee training. Then pivoted into software engineering — building healthcare technology to optimize physician workflows while maintaining compliant, detailed patient notes.

### SomeAI — Co-Founder & COO

Started as a Full Stack Engineer building a real-time sports information web app with secure payments and complex game logic (Flutter, Firebase). Within months, elevated to COO. Developed and implemented the project management system and centralized communications that launched Sounder (iOS + web) on a fixed timeline. Collaborated across marketing and sales for product visibility.

## SumAI Relevance

### Role: Co-Founder & COO

Austin is the operational engine that converts vision into shipping product. While Jack architects and Joseph researches, Austin builds the systems that make the work actually happen — project management, communications infrastructure, launch timelines, marketing coordination. He is the reason Sounder shipped.

### Pillar: Touch (primary) + Brain

Chiropractic is the purest expression of the Touch pillar in medicine — the practitioner's hands as diagnostic instruments, the spine as signal substrate, the adjustment as intervention. His transition to software engineering adds the Brain pillar. Together: a clinician who understands the body AND builds the software to make organizations work.

### Charlotte Connection

- **Clinical signal processing:** Every chiropractic assessment is a multi-SIGNAL evaluation — posture, range of motion, palpation findings, neurological response. The body is a NODE emitting METRICs.
- **Practice as Charlotte substrate:** Running NoHo Chiropractic was running a Charlotte instance — patients as NODEs, appointments as SIGNALs, treatment plans as PROTOCOLs, outcomes as METRICs.
- **Operations as PROTOCOL:** The project management system he built for SomeAI is literally a PROTOCOL — behavioral contracts that define expected workflows and measure deviation from plan.
- **Builder of the launch infrastructure:** Austin built the systems that shipped Sounder. That is the SomeAI engine in action.
