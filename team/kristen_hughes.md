## Identity

**Name:** Kristen (Belyea) Hughes, PE
**Location:** Cincinnati, Ohio
**Current Role:** Project Manager, Schaefer (structural/civil engineering)
**Husband:** Matt Hughes — Optical Engineer, Rose-Hulman (also on team)
**Team Role:** Core Team — Touch Pillar (structural engineering, construction, project management)

## Background

Kristen Hughes is a PE-licensed civil engineer with both a bachelor's and master's from Rose-Hulman and 8 years at Schaefer progressing from design engineer to project manager. She interned at three of the largest construction and engineering firms in the country — Skanska, Bowen Engineering, and Kiewit — before she graduated. That is four consecutive summers of field experience across civil, structural, and construction engineering before entering full-time practice.

### Career Trajectory

```
Rose-Hulman (B.S. + M.Eng. Civil Engineering) → Skanska (field) → Bowen (construction) →
Kiewit (civil + structural) → Schaefer (design → project engineer → project manager, 8yr)
```

## Career

### Schaefer — 8 Years (March 2018 - Present), Cincinnati, OH

| Period | Role |
|--------|------|
| Jan 2022 - Present | Project Manager |
| Jan 2021 - Dec 2022 | Project Engineer |
| Mar 2018 - Jan 2021 | Design Engineer |

Schaefer is a structural and civil engineering consulting firm. Kristen's progression from design engineer to project manager in 4 years reflects both technical depth and operational leadership.

### Internships (4 consecutive summers)

| Year | Company | Role | Focus |
|------|---------|------|-------|
| Summer 2014 | Skanska USA Civil | Field Engineer Intern | Piping, cable, instrument installation; scheduling; cost tracking |
| Summer 2015 | Bowen Engineering | Engineering Intern | Change orders, concrete pours, cost tracking for steel/rebar/concrete/ductwork |
| Summer 2016 | Kiewit | Civil Engineering & Design Intern | Stormwater analysis software, shop drawing review, multi-discipline coordination |
| Summer 2017 | Kiewit | Structural Engineering Intern | Steel support structure design, skid foundations, vendor drawing review |

Four internships across three of the largest construction/engineering firms in the US — Skanska (Swedish multinational, $18B+ revenue), Kiewit (Fortune 500, $14B+ revenue), and Bowen Engineering (regional heavy civil). This is more field experience before graduation than most engineers accumulate in their first five years of practice.

## SumAI Relevance

### Role: Core Team — Touch Pillar

Kristen brings structural and civil engineering — the science of how physical structures bear loads, resist forces, and interface with the ground. Every building, bridge, and foundation is a spatial substrate. Her PE license means she can stamp drawings — legal authority to certify that a structure will perform as designed.

### Charlotte Connection

- **Structural engineering IS spatial reasoning formalized:** Every structural design is a spatial model — loads as SIGNALs, members as NODEs, connections as EDGEs, building codes as PROTOCOLs. Charlotte's spatial substrate is the digital version of what structural engineers model physically.
- **Project management as PROTOCOL execution:** Managing a construction project is running a PROTOCOL — a behavioral contract defining what should happen when, with continuous measurement of actual vs expected progress. Kristen has managed this at scale for 4+ years.
- **Field experience across the construction stack:** Piping, concrete, structural steel, stormwater, instruments — she has touched every material and system that makes a building work. This is full-spectrum Touch pillar knowledge.
- **Rose-Hulman cluster (9th member):** Kristen and Matt make the Rose-Hulman contingent a dual-household presence. B.S. + M.Eng. = double Rose-Hulman graduate.
- **The Hughes pair:** Matt (optical engineering / Sight) + Kristen (civil engineering / Touch) together span from photons to foundations — the full physical stack from light to load.
