## Intellectual Lineage

### Academic Advisors & Influences

**Ken Forbus** (Northwestern QRG)
- Companions architecture
- Knowledge Representation & Reasoning (KRR)
- Analogical reasoning, memory-centric AI

**Kris Hammond** (Northwestern)
- Case-Based Reasoning
- "Memory before abstraction"

**Dave Ferrucci** (Watson)
- Large-scale symbolic reasoning systems
- Adversarial robustness in explanation

**Louis Rosenberg** (Unanimous AI)
- Swarm intelligence
- Human-AI collective cognition
- Conviction and entrenchment in clusters

### Foundational Teacher

**Dave Genger** — Science teacher at LFCDS who introduced Jack to robotics and his brother to insects and animals. Helped coin "SomeAI" (Some Animal Intelligence) because "artificial isn't artificial if it's human-centric." Died three months after Jack graduated middle school (~2010). His influence persists as a standing wave across both brothers' trajectories, reconverging in the agricultural systems work and the naming of the research lab.

## Early Signals

**Iron Man (Kindergarten):**
> "Ever since I read my first Iron Man comic in kindergarten, I have strived to be a more humble Tony Stark. This motivated my degree in computer science as well as my MS in Artificial Intelligence."

The builder archetype was established at age 5-6. Not adopted later—present from the beginning.

**LEGO Competitions:**
Favorite memory from LFCDS: "preparing and competing in the LEGO competitions." Systems thinking was the reward, not the outcome.

**The Lion King Protocol:**
> "In my family we have a special appreciation of The Lion King. Whenever a seemingly insurmountable obstacle arises, my parents simply say 'Lion King' and my marching orders are immediately defined. Being the Lion King means accepting your responsibilities and the circumstances you are in, taking a deep breath, and facing anything and everything with your head held high."

A named trigger that generates expected behavior. Resilience encoded as a callable function.

## Professional Experience

### LineLeap (2017–Present)

**Role:** Co-Founder, CTO
**Funding:** Y Combinator Summer 2019
**Outcome:** $100M+ business, exited

Built and scaled a nightlife technology platform from University of Michigan origin to 175,000+ users across 50+ cities. Shipped and maintained millions of lines of production code.

**Stack:** Flutter, JavaScript/TypeScript, Firebase/Firestore, distributed cloud infrastructure

**Operating Conditions:**
- Real revenue pressure
- Fraud and ops constraints
- Large-scale human behavioral variability

**Key Lesson:**
> Individual events are noise; identity-level trajectories over time are signal.

---

### Aptiv — Forensic Engineering (Summers, 2015-2017)

Worked on autonomous vehicle systems and forensic reconstruction. Reconstructed car accidents using time-indexed signals from vehicle subsystems. Outputs used in legal/court contexts to establish fault, demonstrate driver behavior, and prove systems worked as intended.

**Requirements:**
- Immutable data
- Provenance
- Explainability
- Adversarial robustness

**Key Lesson:**
> Systems emit testimony; explanation is evidence-backed narration, not inference.

---

### Sounder / AgTech / Biological Systems

Built systems for livestock breeding and show pig operations. Modeled genetics, nutrition, gestation timelines, and outcomes delayed by months or generations.

**Operating Conditions:**
- Opinion-heavy domains
- Sparse and noisy data
- Slow feedback loops

**Key Lesson:**
> In biological systems, you cannot optimize outcomes—only shape trajectories.

---

### Industrial Service Group (ISG) — Mechanical Systems

Modeled long-lived equipment lifecycles. Focused on drift detection, deviation from expectation, and service prediction. Failures are rare, expensive, and forensic in hindsight.

**Key Lesson:**
> Prediction is detecting deviation early enough to act, not forecasting dates.

---

### Swarm Intelligence & Collective Cognition

Deep study of conviction, entrenchment, and belief topology in groups. Studied swarm systems (Unanimous AI) not for accuracy, but for internal state visibility, stability vs brittleness, coherence vs fragile consensus.

**Key Lesson:**
> Consensus without conviction structure is uninterpretable.

---

## The Convex Hull

Five domains, five lessons, one architecture:

| Domain | Lesson | Charlotte Primitive |
|--------|--------|---------------------|
| LineLeap (humans) | Individual events are noise; trajectories are signal | SIGNAL over time |
| Aptiv (forensics) | Explanation is evidence-backed narration | Immutable history |
| Sounder (biology) | Cannot optimize outcomes—only shape trajectories | PROTOCOL as expectation |
| ISG (machines) | Prediction is deviation detection | Deviation from expected |
| Swarm (collective) | Consensus without conviction is uninterpretable | Recursive flocking |

## Charlotte: The Architecture

### Purpose

To convert real-world activity into sterile, inspectable, symbolic fact stacks so reasoning and explanation can emerge from truth, not prediction.

### Foundational Principles

1. Time is the primary axis of truth
2. History is append-only
3. Identities emit signals
4. Meaning is derived, not stored
5. Expectations and observations are separate
6. Explanation > prediction
7. No hidden state
8. No ontology hand-authoring
9. No black-box decision making

### What Charlotte Is Not

- Not a dashboard
- Not a workflow engine
- Not an agent that "decides"

### What Charlotte Is

Infrastructure for observable reality, capable of supporting humans, animals, machines, cultural artifacts, and organizations across minutes, years, generations, and centuries.

## SomeAI: The Research Lab

**Name Origin:** "Some Animal Intelligence" — because artificial isn't artificial if it's human-centric. Humans are animals. The goal is sharing human intelligence with humans, not creating something separate.

Coined with influence from Dave Genger's parallel tracks: Jack into robotics/AI, his brother into insects/animals. The branches reconverged.

---

## How Jack Thinks

**Thinks in:** nodes, signals, trajectories, drift, lifecycles

**Distrusts:** mutable history, opaque models, AI without provenance, "smart" agents without grounding

**Values:** reconstructability, adversarial robustness, explanations that survive scrutiny

---

## Long-Term Orientation

Thinks in decades, not quarters.

**Cares about:**
- Systems that outlive their creators
- Truth that can be reconstructed after people are gone
- Institutional continuity

**Commitments:**
- Midwest institutions
- Talent pipelines
- Mentorship
- Knowledge transfer

> "I cherish the opportunities I was provided growing up and want to ensure those who invested in me are paid back tenfold."

## The Resonance Principle

Dave Genger's ENDED_ON date was 2010. His signal history ended, but his influence persists as a standing wave. Jack is still resonating with patterns Dave established. The trajectory—robotics → AI → biological systems → infrastructure for observable reality—traces back to a teacher who didn't live to see any of it.

This is Paper 11. Time folding. Posthumous resonance. The dead teach the living.

---

## Canonical Summary

> Jack Richard is an engineer-founder with deep grounding in knowledge representation, symbolic reasoning, swarm intelligence, and real-world production systems, who builds infrastructure that turns time-aligned signals into inspectable symbolic fact stacks so reasoning and explanation can emerge from truth rather than prediction.
