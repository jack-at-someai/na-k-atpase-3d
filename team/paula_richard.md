## Identity

**Name:** Paula Richard
**Current Role:** Co-Founder & CEO, SomeAI
**Team Role:** Leadership — CEO and operational center of SomeAI

---

## Role

Paula Richard is the CEO of SomeAI and the operational center holding the entire enterprise together. If Jack is the chaotic creative force — the architect who sees the veil behind how AI works and cannot stop building — Paula is the person who turns that chaos into a functioning company.

The Tony Stark / Pepper Potts analogy is Jack's own framing, and it is precise: the visionary who cannot stop inventing needs someone who ensures the inventions become products, the products become contracts, and the contracts become revenue. Paula is that person.

## SumAI Relevance

### Role: Co-Founder & CEO

As CEO, Paula sits at the operational center of SomeAI — the convergent engine that deploys Charlotte to clients. While the research lab (SumAI) diverges into new domains and the engineering team builds, the CEO ensures that all of it converges into deliverables, timelines, and client relationships.

### Charlotte Connection

- **The CEO as central NODE:** Every organizational decision flows through the CEO. In Charlotte's terms, the CEO is the highest-degree node in the organizational graph — connected to every department, every client relationship, every operational decision.
- **Operations as PROTOCOL:** Running a company is running a set of PROTOCOLs — behavioral contracts that define how the organization operates, what is expected, and where deviation triggers intervention.
- **SomeAI's convergent engine:** SumAI diverges (research). SomeAI converges (deployment). Paula runs the convergent engine.
