## Identity

**Name:** Mason Homoly
**Current Role:** VP of Operations, Homoly Design + Build
**Team Role:** Core Team — Touch Pillar (construction, operations, built environment)
**Father:** Andrew Homoly, P.E. (also on SumAI team — the Homoly father-son pair)

## Background

Mason is a builder. Not in the Silicon Valley sense of the word — in the literal sense. He manages the construction of physical structures: foundations, framing, mechanical systems, finish work, occupancy. Eight-plus years of construction project management at Homoly Design + Build, the company his father Andrew Homoly founded, have given Mason an operational fluency in the built environment that most engineers experience only through drawings and specifications.

The VP of Operations title at a design-build firm means Mason owns the execution side: scheduling, subcontractor coordination, material procurement, quality control, site safety, client communication, budget management. This is the Touch Pillar's domain — the physical world, built by hands, governed by gravity and materials science and the hard constraints of construction sequencing.

### Career Trajectory

```
University of Missouri (Civil Engineering) --> Homoly Design + Build (Operations) --> VP of Operations
```

Civil engineering at Mizzou provides the structural and geotechnical foundation. The family business provides the operational context — not a corporate rotation program, but a company where every project decision has direct consequences for the family's reputation, finances, and relationships. That accountability produces a different kind of project manager.

## Education

| Institution | Degree | Notes |
|-------------|--------|-------|
| University of Missouri (Mizzou) | B.S. Civil Engineering | Columbia, MO |

Civil engineering is the discipline of designing and building the physical infrastructure that civilization depends on — bridges, roads, buildings, water systems, foundations. The Mizzou program provides the structural analysis, geotechnical engineering, and construction management fundamentals that Mason applies daily at Homoly Design + Build.

## Career

### Homoly Design + Build — VP of Operations

8+ years in construction project management, now serving as VP of Operations. Homoly Design + Build is his father Andrew Homoly's company — a design-build firm that handles both the architectural design and the physical construction of residential projects.

**VP of Operations scope:**

| Function | Detail |
|----------|--------|
| Project Management | Scheduling, milestone tracking, critical path management across multiple concurrent projects |
| Subcontractor Coordination | Managing the network of specialized trades — electrical, plumbing, HVAC, framing, concrete, finish carpentry |
| Material Procurement | Supply chain management for construction materials — lumber, concrete, fixtures, mechanical systems |
| Quality Control | Ensuring construction meets specifications, code requirements, and client expectations |
| Site Safety | OSHA compliance, hazard identification, crew safety protocols |
| Client Communication | Translating construction progress and decisions into language clients understand |
| Budget Management | Cost tracking, change order management, margin protection |

### The Design-Build Model

Design-build is significant. In traditional construction, the architect designs the building and a separate general contractor builds it. The two entities often have adversarial relationships — the architect wants beauty, the contractor wants buildability, and the owner is caught in between. Design-build firms like Homoly integrate both functions, which means Mason operates at the seam between design intent and construction reality. He sees both sides daily.

This integrative perspective — understanding both what was designed and what can actually be built — is exactly the kind of systems thinking the Touch Pillar requires.

## Specialties

| Domain | Detail |
|--------|--------|
| Construction Operations | Full-lifecycle project execution from groundbreaking to occupancy |
| Project Management | Multi-project scheduling, resource allocation, critical path analysis |
| Residential Construction | Design-build residential projects — custom homes, renovations, additions |
| Team Leadership | Managing crews, subcontractors, and client relationships simultaneously |
| Design-Build Integration | Bridging architectural design intent and construction execution |

## The Homoly Father-Son Pair

Mason and his father Andrew Homoly form one of the research lab's structured generational bridges:

| Person | Role | Perspective |
|--------|------|-------------|
| Andrew Homoly, P.E. | Founder, Homoly Design + Build | Design and engineering — the vision, the drawings, the structural calculations |
| Mason Homoly | VP of Operations, Homoly Design + Build | Operations and execution — the crews, the schedule, the physical construction |

Together they span the full lifecycle of the built environment: from design through construction. Andrew sees the building as an engineering problem. Mason sees it as an operational problem. The building itself does not care about the distinction — it exists at the intersection of both.

This father-son bridge mirrors the Calzada pair (Norberto the cardiologist and Diego the chef) — structured generational connections within the research lab where the parent brings the theoretical/professional foundation and the child brings the applied/operational perspective. In both cases, the combination is more powerful than either individual.

## SumAI Relevance

### Pillar: Touch (primary)

The Touch Pillar studies the built environment, physical interaction, haptics, construction, and the material world. Mason's construction operations background anchors the pillar in the most tangible domain possible: building physical structures that people live and work in.

Construction is the ultimate Touch Pillar discipline. Every material has a physical property — weight, hardness, thermal conductivity, moisture resistance. Every joint is a physical interface. Every building is a spatial substrate that humans inhabit and interact with through touch, movement, and physical presence. Mason does not study these things abstractly — he manages their assembly daily.

### Charlotte Connection

- **Crews as NODEs:** Every worker, subcontractor, and project manager on a construction site is a NODE — an identity emitting signals over time. Their location, their task status, their hours worked, their quality of output — all SIGNALs. Charlotte's graph makes the actual network of human coordination on a jobsite observable.
- **Tasks as PROTOCOLs:** A construction schedule is a network of PROTOCOLs — behavioral contracts that define expected sequences: "foundation must be poured before framing begins," "rough electrical must be inspected before drywall closes the walls," "final grade must be complete before landscaping." Every dependency is a PROTOCOL with preconditions and postconditions.
- **Material flows as SIGNALs:** Lumber deliveries, concrete pours, fixture installations — every material movement is a SIGNAL that Charlotte can track over time and space. Delays, substitutions, and waste are deviations from expected SIGNAL patterns.
- **Buildings as spatial substrates:** A building under construction is a spatial substrate being assembled in real-time. Charlotte's pre-built spatiotemporal substrate can model the building at every stage — from excavation through occupancy — with each room, wall, and system as a traversable spatial node.
- **Operational + design = full lifecycle:** Mason's operational perspective complements his father Andrew's design and engineering perspective. Together they give the Touch Pillar coverage from concept through completion — the same full-lifecycle observability that Charlotte provides for any domain.
- **The father-son bridge as compound knowledge:** The Homoly pair demonstrates the same generational compounding that Charlotte's temporal substrate encodes. Andrew's decades of design experience are the foundation; Mason's operational execution is the amplification. Knowledge compounds rather than resets.
