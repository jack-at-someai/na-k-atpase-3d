## Background

Molly Mosier is a fine artist who became an industrial distribution operator. She holds a BFA with a specialization in oil painting from the American Academy of Art in Chicago — four years of classical fine art training in one of the oldest art schools in the Midwest. Then she went to Grainger and stayed for eight years, progressing from inside sales to government accounts to customer lifecycle project management to senior merchandising analyst.

That trajectory — oil painting to industrial supply chain analytics — is not a contradiction. It is the same perceptual skill applied at different scales. A painter observes color, light, composition, and spatial relationships. A merchandising analyst observes product relationships, customer behavior, pricing patterns, and lifecycle dynamics. Both require the ability to see what others miss and organize complexity into coherent structure.

One trait worth noting: Molly can identify more colors than almost anyone. That is not a casual observation — it is a measurable perceptual ability. Tetrachromacy and enhanced color discrimination are studied phenomena, and artists who train in oil painting develop their color vocabulary far beyond the average person. Molly's color perception is exceptional even in that context. This is a Sight pillar characteristic worth studying — the gap between what a trained observer sees and what an untrained observer sees is exactly the gap Charlotte is designed to close computationally.

She and Evan met at Grainger. The Mosier household is a dual-Grainger pair — two people who have each spent 8+ years inside the same $16B industrial distribution machine, in overlapping but distinct roles. Together they represent nearly two decades of institutional knowledge about how physical products move from manufacturers to the businesses that need them.

## Career

### Grainger — 8 years 2 months (2018 - Present)

| Period | Role |
|--------|------|
| Aug 2024 - Present | Senior Merchandising Analyst |
| Nov 2022 - Aug 2024 | Customer Lifecycle Project Manager |
| Dec 2020 - Nov 2022 | Government Account Relationship Manager |
| Jul 2019 - Dec 2020 | Coverage Sales Associate (Lake Forest, IL) |
| Jan 2018 - Jul 2019 | Inside Sales (Lake Forest, IL) |

The customer lifecycle project manager role is the standout. That position required tracking customer NODEs through their entire relationship with Grainger — acquisition, onboarding, growth, retention, win-back. That is Charlotte's observation model applied to commercial relationships: identities emitting signals over time, measured against expected behavior.

### Victoria's Secret — Selling Supervisor (2016-2017)
Managed retail sales team. First leadership role after art school.

## SumAI Relevance

### Role: Core Team — Sight + Touch Pillar

Molly spans two pillars. Sight comes from her fine art training — four years of learning to observe, compose, and render what the eye sees. Touch comes from eight years in industrial distribution — the physical flow of products through supply chains. The combination is rare: someone who can see patterns aesthetically AND operationally.

### Mentorship Under Jim Richard

Molly has expressed strong interest in being mentored by Jim Richard. Jim's 40+ years of industrial operations and PE leadership represent the next level of the trajectory Molly is already on — from managing customer lifecycles at a single company to understanding how entire industrial enterprises are built, acquired, and scaled. Jim's mentorship connects Molly's Grainger expertise to the broader PE-backed industrial service ecosystem that SomeAI operates in.

### Charlotte Connection

- **Customer lifecycle management IS Charlotte's temporal model:** Tracking a customer from acquisition through retention is tracking a NODE through time — every touchpoint is a SIGNAL, every stage transition is a state change, every expected-vs-actual comparison is a PROTOCOL deviation measurement. Molly managed this at Grainger for nearly two years.
- **Fine art as perceptual training:** Oil painting requires observing spatial relationships, color harmonics, and compositional balance that most people cannot see. That trained perception transfers directly to data visualization, pattern recognition, and the ability to notice when something in a complex system looks wrong.
- **The Mosier pair:** Evan (healthcare sales → government accounts → merchandising analytics) + Molly (fine art → customer lifecycle → merchandising analytics). Together they cover Grainger's commercial stack from two different angles — his is product-facing, hers is customer-facing. Combined with their overlapping government account experience, the Mosier household has nearly 17 years of Grainger institutional knowledge.
- **Grainger as ISG's supply chain layer:** ISG is SomeAI's first client. Grainger is the kind of distributor that feeds industrial service companies like ISG. Having two senior Grainger analysts on the team means Charlotte's industrial models are informed by people who understand the distribution layer from the inside.
