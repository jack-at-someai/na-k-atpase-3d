## Military Career

### United States Navy — Ocean Engineer

Career spanning multiple global rotations. All things ocean — engineering, operations, and strategy at the intersection of naval architecture, oceanography, and amphibious warfare.

**Most Recent Assignment:**
- **The Pentagon** — Amphibious Warfare Branch. Completed rotation in the Navy's expeditionary warfare directorate, which falls under OPNAV. Strategic-level planning for amphibious operations, ship-to-shore movement, and naval force projection.

**Career Context:**
- At 34 with ~10-12 years of commissioned service, likely Lieutenant Commander (O-4) or senior Lieutenant (O-3)
- Pentagon staff rotations at this career stage indicate a competitive career track
- Global deployments spanning multiple theaters of operation

| Ocean Engineering | Naval vessel systems, marine structures, underwater operations |
| Scuba & Diving | Deep expertise — all things ocean and scuba |
| Amphibious Warfare | Pentagon-level strategic planning |

## LFCDS Connection

DJ and Jack both attended Lake Forest Country Day School. DJ's mother, **Kimberly Kim**, taught at LFCDS for years — making the school a multi-generational anchor for the Kim family, just as Dave Genger's science classroom was formative for the Richard brothers.

The childhood connection between Jack and DJ — two kids who got their Rescue Diver certifications together — reconverges decades later in SumAI's Ocean Science pillar. Jack builds the Charlotte substrate for marine observation. DJ brings the operational ocean expertise from the world's most advanced navy. The pattern is familiar: childhood seeds, professional convergence.

## SumAI Relevance

### Pillar: Ocean Science (Sound + Sight + Smell)

DJ is Jack Richard's primary advisor for the Ocean Science vertical — swarm intelligence for reef restoration, marine behavior signals, underwater acoustics, water chemistry monitoring. His Navy career gives him firsthand operational knowledge of:

- **Oceanographic surveying** — the Navy maps more ocean floor than any civilian entity
- **Underwater acoustics** — sonar, submarine detection, marine mammal monitoring
- **Amphibious operations** — coordinating complex multi-domain operations in coastal environments
- **Diving operations** — from recreational rescue diving to military underwater engineering

### Charlotte Connection

- **Signal over time:** Naval ocean engineering is fundamentally about sensing the marine environment — sonar pings, current measurements, salinity readings, bathymetric surveys. Every measurement is a SIGNAL emitted by the ocean as a NODE.
- **Swarm coordination:** Amphibious warfare is swarm intelligence at scale — coordinating dozens of vessels, aircraft, and landing craft through a shared operational picture. Charlotte's PROTOCOL primitive maps directly to naval operational orders.
- **Spatial substrate:** The ocean is the ultimate spatial computing problem — three-dimensional, constantly moving, poorly mapped. Charlotte's pre-built spatiotemporal substrate is designed for exactly this kind of environment.

## The Advisor Relationship

DJ is not a mentor — he is an **advisor**. The distinction matters in SumAI's team structure:

- **Mentors** are domain veterans who teach patterns and provide decades of expertise
- **Advisors** are peers or near-peers who bring specialized operational knowledge and steer research direction

DJ and Jack are the same age, came up together, and share a foundational experience (diving). DJ brings the operational Navy perspective; Jack brings the Charlotte substrate. The advisor relationship is lateral, not hierarchical — two people who see the ocean from different angles, combining their views.

## Public Profile

Effectively zero public digital footprint. Consistent with active-duty military service, particularly for an officer who has served in sensitive Pentagon assignments in amphibious warfare.
