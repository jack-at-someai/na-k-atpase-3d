## SumAI Relevance

### Role: Advisor — Research Lab Board

Dr. Calzada serves on the SumAI research lab advisory board alongside Jim Richard. His presence bridges cardiology (the heart as signal emitter), interventional medicine (the intersection of Touch and Sight pillars), and Latin American medical networks.

### Charlotte Connection

- **Cardiac signals over time:** Cardiology is fundamentally signal processing — ECG waveforms, hemodynamic measurements, cardiac catheterization pressure tracings. Every cardiac measurement is a SIGNAL emitted by the heart as a NODE.
- **Interventional procedures:** Catheter-based interventions are real-time spatial navigation through vascular anatomy — the intersection of Touch (haptics) and Sight (fluoroscopic imaging).
- **Johns Hopkins link:** Hospital Punta Pacifica is Johns Hopkins-affiliated. Dr. Paul Beinhoff is at Johns Hopkins psychiatry. The institutional connections create natural research corridors.
- **International reach:** Well-traveled cardiologist with training at four US institutions and practice in Panama — the kind of global network density that feeds the research lab's expanding convex hull.

### The Calzada Bridge

Father and son represent a unique cross-pillar connection:
- **Norberto** → Medicine (Sight + Touch + Brain) → Advisory Board
- **Diego** → Culinary Science (Taste + Smell + Touch) → Core Team

The medical precision of the father and the sensory artistry of the son, converging in a research lab built to study exactly this: how the senses work, and what happens when you combine them.
