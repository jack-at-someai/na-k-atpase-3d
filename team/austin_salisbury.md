## Identity

**Name:** Austin Salisbury
**Credentials:** PE (Professional Engineer)
**Hometown:** Gurnee, Illinois (Chicago North Shore — same area as Jack Richard)
**Current Role:** E&I Project Engineer, Marathon Petroleum Corporation
**Team Role:** Core Team — Smell Pillar (chemical sensing, analyzers, process instrumentation, industrial controls)

## Background

Austin is a dual-degree engineer out of Rose-Hulman with eight years of heavy industrial experience at one of the largest petroleum refiners in the United States. His career has spanned the full spectrum of industrial instrumentation — from vibration analysis on rotating equipment to leading a $150M+ electrical infrastructure upgrade program. The through-line is sensing: every role has been about detecting what is happening inside machines, pipes, and processes that cannot be observed with the naked eye.

The PE license is not decorative. It means Austin is legally accountable for the engineering designs he stamps — a level of professional responsibility that most software engineers never encounter. In the world of safety instrumented systems, where a bad calculation can cause an explosion, that accountability is the baseline.

### Career Trajectory

```
Rose-Hulman (ME + EE) --> Marathon Petroleum (Reliability) --> Marathon Petroleum (E&I Project Engineering)
```

The dual degree in Mechanical and Electrical Engineering is the foundation. Mechanical gives the understanding of rotating equipment, vibration, and thermodynamics. Electrical gives the understanding of instrumentation, power systems, and control logic. Together they produce an engineer who can see both the physical process and the electronic nervous system that monitors it.

## Career at Marathon Petroleum Corporation

### 8 Years — Two Major Roles

| Period | Role | Scope |
|--------|------|-------|
| Earlier tenure | Rotating Reliability Engineer | Vibration analysis, predictive maintenance, rotating equipment health monitoring |
| Current | E&I Project Engineer | Led $150M+ electrical infrastructure upgrade program across refinery operations |

### Rotating Reliability Engineer

Predictive maintenance through vibration analysis — attaching accelerometers to pumps, compressors, turbines, and motors, then reading the frequency signatures to detect bearing wear, misalignment, imbalance, and structural resonance before catastrophic failure occurs. This is literally listening to machines through their vibrations. The machine is a NODE emitting SIGNALS (vibration spectra) over time, and the reliability engineer's job is to detect when those signals deviate from expected patterns.

### E&I Project Engineer — $150M+ Electrical Infrastructure Program

Leading the design and execution of major electrical and instrumentation upgrades across Marathon's refinery operations. This is not maintenance — it is rebuilding the sensory nervous system of an entire industrial facility. Scope includes:

- **Safety Instrumented Systems (SIS):** The systems that automatically shut down a process when conditions exceed safe operating limits. Every SIS is a PROTOCOL in Charlotte's terms — a behavioral contract that defines expected operating ranges and mandates specific responses to threshold violations.
- **Process Analyzers:** Instruments that measure the chemical composition of process streams in real-time — gas chromatographs, opacity monitors, pH meters, dissolved oxygen sensors. These are chemical sensing at industrial scale.
- **Industrial Controls:** PLCs, DCS, SCADA — the control systems that read sensor data and actuate responses. The brain of the refinery.
- **HAZOP & P&ID:** Hazard and Operability Studies and Piping & Instrumentation Diagrams — the formal methods for analyzing process risk and documenting instrumentation architecture.

## Professional Licensure

**Professional Engineer (PE)** — licensed. The PE license in the context of refinery electrical and instrumentation work means Austin can stamp engineering designs for safety-critical systems. In petroleum refining, "safety-critical" is not metaphorical — it means the difference between a controlled shutdown and a catastrophic release.

## Specialties

| Domain | Detail |
|--------|--------|
| Safety Instrumented Systems (SIS) | Automated shutdown logic, safety integrity levels (SIL), IEC 61511 compliance |
| Process Analyzers | Gas chromatographs, continuous emissions monitoring, chemical composition sensing |
| Industrial Controls | PLC/DCS/SCADA programming, control loop tuning, instrument calibration |
| HAZOP | Hazard and Operability Studies — systematic process risk analysis |
| P&ID | Piping & Instrumentation Diagrams — the engineering documentation of process flow and instrumentation |
| Vibration Analysis | Predictive maintenance through frequency-domain analysis of rotating equipment |
| Predictive Maintenance | Condition-based monitoring to detect failures before they occur |

## The Gurnee Connection

Austin is from Gurnee, Illinois — the Chicago North Shore corridor that includes Lake Forest, where Jack Richard grew up. The geographic proximity is not incidental. The North Shore corridor produces a disproportionate number of Midwestern engineers who end up in heavy industry. Austin's path from Gurnee to Rose-Hulman to Marathon Petroleum follows the same Midwest industrial pipeline that runs through the Richard family's history.

## Rose-Hulman Cluster

Austin is a member of the Rose-Hulman cluster within the SumAI research lab. Rose-Hulman Institute of Technology — consistently ranked the #1 undergraduate engineering school in the US by US News — has become a natural recruiting ground for the lab. The school's emphasis on hands-on engineering and small class sizes produces engineers who think in systems, not abstractions.

## SumAI Relevance

### Pillar: Smell (primary)

Austin's assignment to the Smell Pillar is not metaphorical — it is literal. Process analyzers are chemical sensing instruments. They detect the molecular composition of gases and liquids in real-time: what molecules are present, in what concentrations, at what rates of change. This is exactly what biological olfaction does — detect chemical signals in the environment and convert them to information.

The Smell Pillar studies chemical sensing across scales — from the molecular (gas chromatography, spectroscopy) to the environmental (air quality monitoring, emissions detection) to the biological (olfactory neuroscience, aromatics). Austin's industrial process analyzer experience anchors the pillar in real-world, high-stakes chemical sensing at refinery scale.

### Charlotte Connection

- **Every analyzer reading is a SIGNAL:** A gas chromatograph sampling a process stream every 30 seconds produces a time-series of chemical composition data. Each reading is a SIGNAL emitted by the process stream (a NODE) observed over time. Charlotte's SIGNAL primitive captures exactly this.
- **Every instrument is a NODE:** Temperature transmitters, pressure gauges, flow meters, analyzers, safety valves — each is an identity that emits signals over time. A refinery has thousands of these NODEs, each with its own signal history.
- **Every safety interlock is a PROTOCOL:** A PROTOCOL in Charlotte is a behavioral contract — "if this METRIC exceeds threshold, trigger this response." A Safety Instrumented System is exactly this: if temperature exceeds X, if pressure exceeds Y, if composition deviates from Z, then shut down. The mapping is one-to-one.
- **The $150M E&I program is infrastructure Charlotte makes observable:** Austin's program is rebuilding the sensory nervous system of an industrial facility. Charlotte is the platform that makes that nervous system's data observable, traversable, and analyzable across time and space.
- **Vibration as signal:** Austin's reliability engineering background — reading vibration spectra to predict equipment failure — is signal processing in the purest sense. The machine's vibration signature is its SIGNAL, and pattern deviation is the METRIC that triggers maintenance PROTOCOLs.
