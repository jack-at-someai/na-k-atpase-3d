## Background

Ken Forbus is a founder of qualitative physics — the area of AI that develops representations and reasoning techniques capturing how people reason about the physical world. Not how computers calculate physics, but how humans *understand* physics qualitatively: "the water is flowing," "the pressure is increasing," "the bridge will hold." This is the intellectual foundation underneath Charlotte's entire knowledge representation approach.

Jack Richard sat in his conversational interfaces lectures at Northwestern and worked with him. Forbus was too prominent to remember one student among many, but his impact on Charlotte is direct and obvious. Charlotte's KRF — S-expression facts encoding qualitative observations about the world — is qualitative reasoning applied to arbitrary domains. The primitives (NODE, EDGE, METRIC, SIGNAL, PROTOCOL) are qualitative representations of entities, relationships, measurements, observations, and behavioral contracts. This is Forbus's field, applied.

## Research

### Core Domains

| Area | Description |
|------|-------------|
| **Qualitative Reasoning** | Co-founder of qualitative physics. Representations that capture how humans reason about the physical world without numerical precision. |
| **Analogical Reasoning** | Structure-mapping theory. How humans (and machines) transfer knowledge from one domain to another by recognizing structural similarity. |
| **Spatial Reasoning** | How agents understand and reason about space, location, containment, paths. |
| **Sketch Understanding** | CogSketch — AI that understands hand-drawn sketches by reasoning about spatial relationships. |
| **Cognitive Architecture** | The Companion architecture — hypothesis that analogical reasoning + qualitative representations are central to cognition. |
| **Natural Language** | Understanding language through qualitative and analogical reasoning, not just statistical patterns. |
| **Knowledge Representation** | Formal systems for encoding world knowledge in machine-readable form. |

### The Companion Cognitive Architecture

Two central hypotheses:
1. **Analogical reasoning and learning are central to cognition** — the ability to see structural similarity between different domains is not a feature of intelligence, it is the mechanism.
2. **Qualitative representations provide a level of description that facilitates reasoning, learning, and communication** — you don't need numerical precision to understand the world. You need the right qualitative abstractions.

### Key Publication

*Qualitative Representations: How People Reason and Learn about the Continuous World* — MIT Press. The definitive text on qualitative reasoning as a foundation for human-like AI.

## SumAI Relevance

### Role: Influence — Brain Pillar

Ken Forbus did not personally mentor Jack Richard the way Kris Hammond did. He was too prominent, too in-demand, with too many students to track one individual in his lectures. But his intellectual influence on Charlotte is DNA-level. Jack sat in his conversational interfaces lectures. Jack worked with him. And then Jack built Charlotte — a system whose entire knowledge representation approach is qualitative reasoning applied to arbitrary domains.

Forbus is not an advisor who will attend meetings. He is an intellectual ancestor whose work is embedded in the architecture.

### Charlotte Connection

- **KRF IS qualitative representation:** Charlotte's Knowledge Representation Format — S-expression facts like `(isa ISG-Equipment-001 CompressorUnit)` and `(hasMetric ISG-Equipment-001 OperatingHours 12450)` — is a qualitative representation system. It encodes what is observable about the world in formal, machine-readable terms. This is exactly what Forbus's qualitative reasoning research produces.

- **The five primitives ARE qualitative abstractions:** NODE, EDGE, METRIC, SIGNAL, PROTOCOL are not numerical quantities. They are qualitative categories that capture the essential structure of any observable domain without requiring domain-specific numerical models. A NODE is a NODE whether it is a compressor, a pig, a violin, or a person. That is qualitative reasoning.

- **Analogical reasoning IS Charlotte's universality:** Charlotte applies the same five primitives to chess, pig breeding, violin provenance, industrial service, and moving companies. The ability to see structural similarity across these domains — and reason about all of them using the same substrate — is structure-mapping. It is Forbus's analogical reasoning thesis in practice.

- **Spatial reasoning IS Charlotte's spatial substrate:** Charlotte's spatial substrate (4,604 lines of KRF encoding US states, adjacencies, regions) is spatial reasoning formalized. Forbus's research on how agents understand space, containment, and paths maps directly to Charlotte's spatial primitives.

- **The Companion architecture's two hypotheses map to Charlotte:** (1) Analogical reasoning is central → Charlotte applies the same patterns across all domains. (2) Qualitative representations facilitate reasoning → Charlotte's KRF provides exactly this level of description.
