## Background

C.J. Yeh has spent 30+ years at the intersection of design, technology, and education. His career spans game design, UX, branding, and experience design — an unusually broad range that converges at a single point: how humans perceive, navigate, and make meaning from designed environments. He is not a single-discipline designer. He is a systems designer whose medium happens to be visual.

### Career Trajectory

```
Pratt BFA → Penn MFA → Teaching (Pratt, Parsons, FIT) → Cynda Media Lab → Johns Hopkins Advisory
```

The thread connecting all of it is experience design — the deliberate engineering of how people move through spaces, interfaces, and information. Whether the space is a hospital, a mobile app, or a transit system, the design problem is the same: shape the behavioral contract between environment and user.

## Academic Career

### Fashion Institute of Technology (FIT) — 23+ Years

Tenured Full Professor in Communication Design. FIT is part of the State University of New York system and one of the premier design schools in the world. 23 years of tenure means C.J. has shaped multiple generations of designers — hundreds of students who now populate agencies, studios, and tech companies across New York and beyond.

**Diego Abad** — currently a student of C.J.'s at FIT — is the direct pipeline connecting C.J.'s academic world to the SumAI research lab.

### Founding Faculty, Parsons School of Design

Helped establish curriculum at Parsons, part of The New School. Founding faculty status means he did not inherit a program — he built one.

### Pratt Institute

Taught at his undergraduate alma mater, completing the cycle from student to educator within the same institutional tradition.

## Cynda Media Lab

Founded Cynda Media Lab — a design consultancy and research studio whose client list reads as a cross-section of institutions that take design seriously:

| Client | Domain |
|--------|--------|
| MIT | Academic / research |
| Google | Technology |
| Starbucks | Consumer experience |
| NYC Transit | Public infrastructure / wayfinding |

The common thread: each of these clients operates at the intersection of massive user populations and designed environments. MIT designs research spaces. Google designs digital interfaces. Starbucks designs retail atmospheres. NYC Transit designs wayfinding for 5.7 million daily riders. In every case, the problem is the same — how do you design the behavioral protocol that guides a human through a system?

## Johns Hopkins Hospital — Creative Advisor

Experience design advisory at Johns Hopkins Hospital. This is not graphic design — this is the design of how patients, families, and clinicians move through one of the most complex physical environments in medicine. Hospital experience design touches wayfinding, emotional atmosphere, information hierarchy in clinical spaces, and the behavioral contracts between patients and their care teams.

This role connects directly to Dr. Paul Beinhoff's work at Johns Hopkins. C.J. designs the experiential layer of the hospital; Paul navigates the clinical layer. The institution is the same. The substrate is the same. The perspectives are complementary — one designs how the space feels, the other operates within it.

## Published Works

Author of **10 books on design** — spanning visual communication, user experience, and design thinking. A publication count of 10 in the design discipline signals a practitioner who documents and systematizes knowledge, not just produces work.

## Awards & Recognition

| Award Body | Significance |
|------------|-------------|
| AIGA | The professional association for design — the gold standard in American graphic design |
| Type Directors Club | Premier typography and typographic design recognition |
| Communication Arts | One of the longest-running design annuals in the world |
| Red Dot | International product and communication design award (Germany) |
| iF Design | International Forum Design Award (Germany) |
| TEDx | Speaker — ideas worth spreading |
| United Nations | Speaker — design at the global institutional level |

Recognition from both American (AIGA, TDC, CA) and international (Red Dot, iF) bodies confirms that C.J.'s work operates at a global standard, not a regional one.

## SumAI Relevance

### Pillar: Sight (primary) — Visual / Experience Design

C.J. Yeh is the Mentor for the Sight Pillar. His 30+ years of experience design — from transit systems to hospitals to consumer brands — represent the deepest possible understanding of how visual systems shape human behavior. The Sight Pillar is not about making things look good. It is about making things observable, navigable, and meaningful. That is exactly what C.J. has spent three decades doing.

### Charlotte Connection

- **Experience design as PROTOCOL:** Every designed experience is a behavioral contract. The wayfinding system in a hospital tells you where to go, what to expect, and how to behave. This is Charlotte's PROTOCOL primitive — a set of expected behaviors against which deviation can be measured. C.J. has been designing PROTOCOLs his entire career; he just calls them experiences.
- **Visual systems as SIGNALs:** Typography, color, spatial hierarchy, motion — these are SIGNALs emitted by designed environments. They carry information. They change over time. They can be measured. Charlotte's SIGNAL primitive captures exactly this kind of continuous, multi-channel emission.
- **The Johns Hopkins bridge:** C.J.'s advisory role at Johns Hopkins Hospital connects to Dr. Paul Beinhoff's psychiatry residency at the same institution. One designs the environment patients and clinicians inhabit. The other operates within it, tracking behavioral and neurological signals. The experiential layer and the clinical layer are two views of the same substrate.
- **Diego Abad pipeline:** C.J.'s student Diego Abad at FIT represents a direct knowledge transfer channel — the Mentor's design thinking flowing into the next generation of SumAI contributors.
