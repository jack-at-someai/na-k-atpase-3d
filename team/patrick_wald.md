## Background

Patrick Wald is an investment consultant from Lake Forest who has spent his entire post-college career in wealth management and financial advisory — first at Merrill Lynch for nearly seven years, now at Fidelity. He grew up with Jack Richard in Lake Forest. While Jack built the computational infrastructure for observable reality, Patrick built the financial literacy to understand how capital flows, how portfolios are constructed, and how institutional money makes decisions.

He started proving himself early. As a summer intern at All Star Financial in 2016, he was tasked with finding a replacement Large Cap Growth fund for underperforming 401K portfolios. He used Morningstar Direct, conducted conference calls with fund managers, presented his analysis to the president and COO, and his recommendation was selected — the firm invested $40-50 million in the fund he chose. That was before he graduated.

## SumAI Relevance

### Role: Core Team — Capital Markets & Financial Infrastructure

Patrick fills the capital markets gap. The lab has engineers, doctors, designers, and scientists — but building a company that will interface with PE firms, manage client portfolios, structure contracts, and eventually raise capital requires someone who speaks the language of institutional finance natively. Patrick has spent 8 years doing exactly that — advising high-net-worth households, managing government and institutional relationships, and understanding how money moves through funds, portfolios, and markets.

### Charlotte Connection

- **Financial markets ARE signal architectures:** Every security is a NODE emitting price SIGNALs over time. Portfolio construction is EDGE topology — which assets connect to which risk factors. Compliance is PROTOCOL — behavioral contracts that constrain what can happen when. Patrick has been reading this signal architecture professionally for 8 years.
- **The $40-50M fund recommendation as an intern:** Before he graduated, Patrick was trusted to analyze, recommend, and deploy tens of millions of dollars. That is not junior-level pattern matching. That is signal analysis under real stakes — the same skill Charlotte applies to every domain.
- **Wealth management as client interface:** SomeAI's double contract model means every client engagement involves money — deployment fees, ongoing service charges, 2-year lock-ins. Patrick understands how institutions evaluate financial commitments, how to present value propositions to people who manage capital for a living, and how to build trust with the $250K+ households that populate the PE ecosystem SomeAI operates in.
- **Lake Forest network:** Patrick grew up with Jack Richard in Lake Forest — the same North Shore community that produced Matt Hughes, DJ Kim's family, and now multiple members of the team. The Lake Forest thread is not just geographic proximity. It is a shared context that makes trust and communication frictionless.
- **Series 7 + Series 66:** Licensed to sell securities and provide investment advice. These are not trivial certifications — they represent regulatory competence in exactly the financial instruments that Charlotte's PE thesis and valuation models describe.
