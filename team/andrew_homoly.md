## Background

Andrew Homoly has spent 29+ years designing and building custom homes. Not tract housing. Not commercial development. Custom — one-of-a-kind structures where every material choice, every structural decision, every spatial relationship is intentional. He is a Professional Engineer, which means he can stamp structural drawings. He is a builder, which means he turns those drawings into physical reality. The combination of licensed engineering and hands-on construction is rare. Most engineers do not build. Most builders are not engineers. Andrew does both.

### Career Trajectory

```
UIUC Civil Engineering → PE License → Homoly Design + Build (29+ years) → National Recognition
```

The trajectory is a straight line. No pivots, no detours. He studied how structures work, got licensed to certify they will stand, and then spent three decades proving it by building them. The simplicity of the path belies the complexity of the work — custom residential construction is one of the most multivariable design challenges in architecture.

## Homoly Design + Build

### Owner/President — 29+ Years

Premier custom home builder in Kansas City. Founded and operated by Andrew for nearly three decades. Custom home construction at this level is not just building — it is orchestrating a complex system of materials, trades, timelines, budgets, codes, and client expectations.

### National Recognition

- **National Custom Home Builder of the Year finalist** — twice. This is recognition from the National Association of Home Builders (NAHB), the industry's primary professional body. Finalist status at the national level means Andrew's work has been judged against the best custom builders in the country and found competitive.

### Specialties

| Domain | Detail |
|--------|--------|
| Green Building | Sustainable construction practices and materials |
| Sustainable Construction | Energy efficiency, environmental impact reduction |
| Construction Management | Full project orchestration from design through completion |
| Custom Residential Design | One-of-a-kind homes — every project is a unique spatial problem |

### Professional Affiliations

- **National Association of Home Builders (NAHB)** — active member

## The PE License

The Professional Engineer designation matters. It means Andrew has passed the Fundamentals of Engineering (FE) exam, accumulated supervised engineering experience, and passed the Principles and Practice of Engineering (PE) exam in civil engineering. He can stamp structural calculations. He can certify that a building will stand. This is not a soft credential — it carries legal liability. Every structure he certifies with his PE stamp is a personal guarantee backed by engineering rigor and professional ethics.

## SumAI Relevance

### Pillar: Touch (primary) — Architecture, Construction, Built Environment, Structural Design

Andrew Homoly is the Mentor for the Touch Pillar. Custom home construction is the most tactile, most physical discipline in the research lab — where materials meet forces, where design meets gravity, where the abstract becomes the built. The Touch Pillar is about the physical world: how things are made, how they hold together, how they respond to stress, how they age. 29 years of custom construction is 29 years of managing these questions at every scale, from foundation to roofline.

### Charlotte Connection

- **Every building is a spatial substrate.** Rooms are NODEs. Hallways and structural connections are EDGEs. Environmental sensors (temperature, humidity, structural stress) are SIGNALs. Building codes and design standards are PROTOCOLs. A custom home, fully instrumented, is a Charlotte graph in physical space.
- **29 years of managing complex spatial relationships.** Custom construction requires holding the entire spatial model of a building in mind while coordinating dozens of trades, thousands of material decisions, and a timeline that stretches over months or years. This is exactly the kind of spatiotemporal complexity Charlotte is designed to make observable.
- **Material properties as METRICs.** Every material in a building has measurable properties — tensile strength, thermal conductivity, moisture resistance, load capacity. These are METRICs in Charlotte's architecture. Andrew has spent three decades selecting, combining, and testing materials against these dimensions.
- **Green building as signal processing.** Sustainable construction is fundamentally about measuring and optimizing energy flows — heat transfer, air exchange, water management, solar gain. These are continuous SIGNALs emitted by the building as a NODE over time. Charlotte's signal-over-time architecture maps directly to building performance monitoring.
- **The Homoly family connection.** Andrew's son Mason Homoly is also on the SumAI team — a multi-generational presence that echoes the Richard family's own generational pattern. The knowledge transfer from father to son in construction parallels the resonance chain described in the Donald Almquist profile.
