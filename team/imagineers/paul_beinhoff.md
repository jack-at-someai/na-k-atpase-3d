## Research Profile

### Publication Count: 7 (PubMed-indexed, as of 2023)

Remarkably broad research portfolio spanning oncology, cardiology, neurology, internal medicine, gastroenterology, family medicine, and mental health — all before entering psychiatry residency. This breadth is unusual and signals a mind that naturally crosses disciplinary boundaries.

## SumAI Relevance

### Pillar: Brain
Paul's trajectory — broad medical research converging into psychiatry at the world's top program — maps directly to the Brain pillar of SumAI. Psychiatry is where all the senses converge into cognition, behavior, and meaning. His research breadth (oncology → cardiology → neurology → mental health → psychiatry) mirrors the cross-sensory progression model of the OASIS.

### Charlotte Connection
- **Signal over time:** Psychiatric diagnosis is fundamentally about tracking behavioral signals over time and detecting deviation from expected patterns — Charlotte's core architecture
- **Medical imaging:** Johns Hopkins psychiatry is at the frontier of neuroimaging for psychiatric diagnosis — the intersection of Sight and Brain pillars
- **Population-level pattern recognition:** His rural residence/cardiac mortality paper shows early instinct for finding signal in population-scale data
- **Cross-disciplinary synthesis:** 7 departments before residency = the kind of mind that naturally does what the OASIS is designed to facilitate

### Potential Research Vectors at SumAI
- Neuroimaging + Charlotte substrate for longitudinal psychiatric assessment
- Signal-based models for treatment response prediction
- Cross-modal observation (behavioral signals + physiological signals + imaging) for early intervention
- Psychiatric applications of Charlotte's deviation-from-expected architecture
