## Identity

**Name:** Matthew Dale
**Current Role:** Aircraft Structural Design Engineer, Aurora Flight Sciences (a Boeing company)
**Team Role:** Core Team — Sight Pillar (aerial sensing, drone/UAS, autonomous flight)
**Cluster:** Rose-Hulman

## Background

Matthew builds the airframes that carry sensors into spaces humans cannot reach. His career arc — from small UAS design at a startup to structural engineering at a Boeing subsidiary — traces the maturation of autonomous flight from hobbyist novelty to national airspace integration. The constant across every role is the same question: how do you build a platform that can fly itself, carry a payload, and survive the structural loads of real-world operation?

### Career Trajectory

```
Rose-Hulman → Streamline Designs (UAS Design, 4.5 years) → Aurora Flight Sciences / Boeing (Aircraft Structural Design)
```

The progression from small drones to full-scale aircraft structural design at Boeing is a scaling story. The physics are the same — aerodynamic loads, composite layups, fatigue life — but the stakes and complexity increase by orders of magnitude. Matthew carried the rapid-iteration mindset of small UAS design into the rigorous structural analysis world of crewed and autonomous military aircraft.

## Professional Experience

### Aurora Flight Sciences (a Boeing company) — Aircraft Structural Design Engineer

Aurora Flight Sciences is Boeing's autonomous systems and advanced aircraft division. They build experimental and production aircraft — both crewed and uncrewed — pushing the boundary of what flies autonomously. Structural design at this level means:

| Domain | Detail |
|--------|--------|
| **Aircraft Structures** | Primary and secondary structure design for advanced airframes |
| **Composite Materials** | Carbon fiber and advanced composite layup design and analysis |
| **Structural Analysis** | FEA, fatigue and damage tolerance, static and dynamic loads |
| **Autonomous Platforms** | Structural integration for uncrewed aerial systems |

### Streamline Designs — UAS/Drone Design Engineer (4.5 years)

Four and a half years designing unmanned aerial systems from the ground up at a small, agile firm. This is where Matthew built his foundational expertise in drone design, composite manufacturing, and the full lifecycle of small UAS — concept through flight test.

**Key Achievement:** Achieved the **first national FAA Beyond Visual Line of Sight (BVLOS) waiver** — a regulatory milestone for autonomous flight in the United States. BVLOS authorization means the drone operates beyond what any human on the ground can see. This is not a technical achievement alone — it is a regulatory and safety case achievement, requiring demonstration that the system can operate safely without a human pilot maintaining visual contact.

### Specialties

| Skill | Detail |
|-------|--------|
| **Carbon Fiber Composites** | Design and manufacturing of composite airframe structures |
| **Additive Manufacturing** | 3D printing for rapid prototyping and flight-ready components |
| **Drone Pilot** | Certified UAS pilot — flies what he builds |
| **Structural Analysis** | FEA, hand calcs, test correlation for aerospace structures |
| **Autonomous Systems** | BVLOS operations, autonomous flight integration |

## SumAI Relevance

### Pillar: Sight (primary)

Matthew is a Sight Pillar engineer because drones are how Charlotte sees the world from above. Every aerial platform is a mobile sensing node — cameras, LIDAR, multispectral sensors — carried into position by an airframe that Matthew knows how to design, build, and fly. The Sight Pillar is not just about image processing. It is about getting the sensor to the right place, at the right time, and keeping it there long enough to observe.

### Charlotte Connection

- **Drones as mobile NODEs:** Every drone is a mobile sensing platform — a NODE that moves through space emitting visual SIGNALs. Matthew's work on autonomous flight and structural design maps directly to Charlotte's spatial substrate. The airframe is the physical instantiation of a Charlotte NODE; the sensors are SIGNAL emitters; the flight path is a trajectory through Charlotte's spatiotemporal grid.
- **Drones are Charlotte's eyes in the sky:** What Charlotte OS does in a room with cameras on tripods, drones do over a farm, a construction site, a reef, or a battlefield. Matthew builds the platforms that extend Charlotte's observable range from room-scale to landscape-scale.
- **BVLOS as extended observation:** The FAA BVLOS waiver represents extending Charlotte's observable range beyond human line of sight. When a drone flies beyond what a pilot can see, it is operating in Charlotte's native mode — autonomous observation of a spatial field, reporting what it sees back to the substrate. BVLOS is not just a regulatory milestone. It is the operational proof that machines can observe domains humans cannot directly supervise.
- **Structural integrity as PROTOCOL:** An airframe's structural limits define a behavioral contract — load envelopes, fatigue life, flutter boundaries. These are PROTOCOLs. When actual loads diverge from expected, the structure tells you. Charlotte's PROTOCOL primitive captures this same pattern.
