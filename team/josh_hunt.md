## Identity

**Name:** Joshua Hunt, MD
**Current Role:** PGY-4 Diagnostic Radiology Resident, Creighton University School of Medicine (Phoenix Campus)
**Hospital:** St. Joseph's Hospital and Medical Center / Barrow Neurological Institute, Phoenix, AZ
**Team Role:** Core Team — Sight + Brain Pillar (medical imaging, radiology, neuroradiology)
**Paired with:** Dr. Paul Beinhoff (Johns Hopkins Psychiatry — neuroimaging)

---

## Background

Josh Hunt is a diagnostic radiologist training at the intersection of two of the most consequential institutions in neuroscience: Creighton's Phoenix campus at St. Joseph's Hospital, which houses **Barrow Neurological Institute** — the facility where Neuralink performed its first human brain-computer interface implant in January 2024 (patient: Noland Arbaugh). He is training in the building where the boundary between human and machine observation is being redrawn.

### Career Trajectory

```
University of Missouri (Biology/Pre-Med) → Creighton University School of Medicine →
Diagnostic Radiology Residency (Creighton Phoenix / Barrow) → [graduating ~2026]
```

## Training Environment

### Barrow Neurological Institute

Barrow is the world's largest dedicated neurological disease treatment and research institution. It is housed within St. Joseph's Hospital and Medical Center in Phoenix — Creighton's primary Phoenix teaching hospital.

Key facts:
- **Neuralink's clinical site** — first human brain-computer interface implant (January 2024)
- World leader in neurosurgical volume (more brain tumor surgeries and cerebrovascular procedures than any other US center)
- Home to one of the nation's top neuroradiology fellowships
- Creighton radiology residents rotate through Barrow's imaging suites, reading brain MRIs, CTs, angiograms, and functional neuroimaging studies

Training at Barrow means reading neuroimaging studies at the highest volume and complexity in the country — stroke, tumor, trauma, degenerative disease, and now brain-computer interfaces.

## SumAI Relevance

### Role: Core Team — Sight + Brain Pillar

Josh Hunt sits alongside Paul Beinhoff as the medical imaging arm of the research lab. Paul brings the neuroimaging and psychiatry perspective from Johns Hopkins. Josh brings diagnostic radiology from Barrow — the institution where the brain-machine boundary is being physically crossed.

Together they represent the full spectrum of medical imaging: Paul on the psychiatric/neuroimaging side (how the brain's signals reveal mental states) and Josh on the diagnostic radiology side (how imaging reveals structural and functional pathology across the entire body).

### Charlotte Connection

- **Radiology IS machine observation of the human body:** Every CT, MRI, X-ray, and ultrasound is a SIGNAL captured from a patient NODE. Radiology is Charlotte's thesis applied to medicine — making the invisible observable through imaging technology.
- **Barrow + Neuralink:** Training at the hospital where Neuralink implanted its first brain-computer interface means Josh is at ground zero for the convergence of biological and digital observation. Charlotte observes organizations. Neuralink observes neurons. The underlying principle — NODEs emitting SIGNALs over time — is identical.
- **Diagnostic reasoning as qualitative reasoning:** A radiologist reads an image and makes qualitative judgments: "this mass is suspicious," "this vessel is narrowed," "this pattern suggests demyelination." This is qualitative reasoning (Forbus's domain) applied through the Sight pillar.
- **Mizzou connection:** Josh joins Logan McDaniel, Austin Neibarger, and Mason Homoly as Mizzou alumni on the team — another institutional thread in the network.
