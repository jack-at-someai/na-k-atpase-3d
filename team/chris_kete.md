## Background

Chris Kete's career is a case study in the trajectory SomeAI serves: elite technical education, military nuclear operations, and a long run through the industrial PE ecosystem as an operator and executive. Cornell engineering gave him the analytical foundation. The Navy nuclear submarine program gave him operational discipline under the most demanding conditions in the military. Harvard MBA gave him the strategic lens. And the last two decades have been spent running, fixing, and scaling industrial companies — exactly the kind of complex operations that need Charlotte's observable infrastructure.

### Career Trajectory

```
Cornell ChemE → Navy Nuclear Subs (5 yrs) → Harvard MBA → Industrial Operations → PE-Backed CEO/President
```

The pattern is consistent: each step adds a layer of operational complexity. From chemistry to nuclear reactors to business strategy to running entire industrial companies. The scale increases. The variables multiply. The need for observable infrastructure becomes more acute at every stage.

## Military Career

### United States Navy — Submarine Warfare Officer

- **Rank:** Lieutenant
- **Duration:** 5 years
- **Qualification:** Nuclear submarine qualified
- **Training:** Naval Nuclear Power School — one of the most technically rigorous training programs in the US military

Nuclear submarine qualification means Chris operated and maintained nuclear reactor systems aboard submarines. This is not a desk job. It is one of the most demanding technical-operational environments in the world — managing a nuclear power plant inside a sealed tube hundreds of feet underwater. The safety culture, procedural rigor, and systems-thinking required for nuclear submarine operations are foundational to everything that followed in his career.

## Industrial & Executive Career

### President — Horsburgh & Scott

This is the direct connection to Jim Richard. Horsburgh & Scott is Jim Richard's company — a gear manufacturing operation in the industrial Midwest. Chris Kete is the President. He is already inside the Richard family's business network, running one of their companies. This is not a cold connection. This is an existing operational relationship.

### Operating Partner — Industrial Service Solutions

Same PE network as ISG (Industrial Service Group). Industrial Service Solutions operates in the same ecosystem of PE-backed industrial service companies that SomeAI's first client comes from. Chris is not adjacent to this world — he is embedded in it.

### ISG Board Member (2020-2022)

Chris sat on the ISG board for two years. He already knows the first client. He has seen their operations from the governance level. When SomeAI deploys Charlotte at ISG, Chris Kete is the advisor who can say "I know what that company looks like from the inside."

### VP/GM — Meritor

Defense contracts exceeding $470M+. Meritor (now part of Cummins) supplies drivetrain and braking systems for military and commercial vehicles. At the VP/GM level with defense contracts of that scale, Chris was managing P&L across complex government-industrial supply chains.

### General Manager — Cummins

Cummins is a Fortune 500 engine and power generation manufacturer. General Manager at Cummins means running a business unit within one of the largest industrial companies in the world.

### Six Sigma Certified

Formal process improvement methodology — the quantitative, data-driven approach to eliminating defects and variability in industrial processes. This is the language Charlotte speaks: measure, observe, detect deviation, improve.

## SumAI Relevance

### Role: Advisor — Strategy & Operations / Advisory Board

Chris Kete is not a domain specialist. He is a strategic operator — the person who has run the kinds of companies SomeAI serves. His value is not in any single technical pillar but in the operational pattern recognition that comes from decades of leading industrial businesses through complexity.

### Charlotte Connection

- **Chris is in Jim Richard's direct network.** He runs Horsburgh & Scott — Jim Richard's company. The connection is not theoretical. It is an existing professional relationship with daily operational overlap.
- **ISG board tenure means he already knows the first client.** Two years on the ISG board (2020-2022) gives Chris governance-level visibility into the company SomeAI is pitching on February 23. He has seen their financials, their operations, their challenges. He can validate what Charlotte reveals because he has already seen the data from the boardroom.
- **His career IS the Charlotte use case.** Navy nuclear operations → defense manufacturing → PE-backed industrial companies. At every stage, the fundamental problem is the same: complex operations generating massive amounts of signal, with insufficient infrastructure to make that signal observable and actionable. Charlotte exists to solve exactly the problem Chris has been managing his entire career.
- **Six Sigma to Charlotte pipeline:** Six Sigma is the manual, human-driven version of what Charlotte automates — measuring processes, detecting deviation, driving improvement. Chris already thinks in Charlotte's language. He just has not had Charlotte's infrastructure.
- **PE network access:** As an Operating Partner at Industrial Service Solutions and a board member at ISG, Chris sits at the center of the PE-backed industrial network that represents SomeAI's primary client pipeline.
