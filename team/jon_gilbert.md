## Background

Jon Gilbert's career arc — journalism to advertising to television production to leveraged finance to private equity co-founder — reads like a case study in the convergence of storytelling and capital structure. The Medill training (how to find the story in the data) feeds directly into the PE instinct (how to find the value in the company). He has invested more than $1 billion of capital across 80+ buyout transactions, and his board portfolio includes both **Industrial Service Solutions** (ISG's PE parent) and **Horsburgh & Scott** (Jim Richard's gear manufacturing company, where Chris Kete was president).

He is not adjacent to Jim Richard's network. He is structurally embedded in it.

### Career Trajectory

```
Northwestern Medill (Journalism) → Advertising → TV Production → Michigan MBA + MPP →
Leveraged Finance (National City Bank) → PE Managing Director (JZ Partners, 10yr) →
Co-Founded KCM Capital Partners (2017)
```

## Education

| Year | Degree | Institution |
|------|--------|-------------|
| 1993-1997 | BSJ, Journalism | Northwestern University, Medill School of Journalism |
| 2001-2004 | Master of Public Policy (International & Economic Policy) | University of Michigan, Gerald R. Ford School |
| 2002-2004 | MBA, Finance & Strategy | University of Michigan, Stephen M. Ross School of Business |

Three degrees spanning journalism, public policy, and finance. The journalism training gives him the narrative instinct — the ability to find the story inside a deal. The public policy degree gives him the systems view. The MBA gives him the financial mechanics.

## SumAI Relevance

### Role: Advisor — Private Equity & Deal Structure

Jon Gilbert's value is structural. He has been inside the PE machinery that created ISG, managed Horsburgh & Scott, and invested across the exact lower middle market industrial/service companies that make up SomeAI's client pipeline. He understands how these companies are bought, built, financed, and sold. When SomeAI needs to structure deals, negotiate contracts, or navigate PE-backed client relationships, Jon has done it 80+ times.

### Charlotte Connection

- **ISG is not new to him:** Jon sat on the board of Industrial Service Solutions at JZ Partners. He knows the ISG entity, its PE structure, its growth model. Charlotte deploying at ISG is not a cold introduction — it is entering a company whose PE lineage Jon helped shape.
- **Horsburgh & Scott overlap:** Jon was board member at H&S. Chris Kete was president. Jim Richard is connected. Three people in the SumAI network were inside the same company at the same time.
- **Lower middle market IS the Charlotte market:** KCM Capital invests in exactly the companies Charlotte serves — $2M-$15M EBITDA business services, specialized manufacturing, value-added distribution. Every portfolio company in Jon's orbit is a potential Charlotte deployment.
- **Journalism → PE → Charlotte:** Jon's Medill training is the narrative instinct — finding the story in data. That is exactly what Charlotte does: make the data observable so the story becomes visible. His career went from telling stories to financing the companies that generate the data. Charlotte closes the loop.
- **Northwestern connection:** Jon (Medill '97) and Jack both went to Northwestern. The institutional thread connects them through the same university that houses Kris Hammond's AI lab.
