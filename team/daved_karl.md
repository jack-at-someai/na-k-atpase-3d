## Background

Daved Karl has spent 30+ years transforming large businesses through technology adoption — and he is currently doing it at ISG, SomeAI's first production client. He is not an outside advisor looking in. He is the CIO/CISO sitting at the center of the enterprise Charlotte is about to enter. He built ISG's current technology stack. He knows every integration point, every security boundary, every data flow. When Charlotte deploys at ISG, it deploys through Daved.

## SumAI Relevance

### Role: Mentor & Advisor

Daved Karl is the rare person who sits on BOTH sides of the SomeAI equation. He is a 30-year enterprise technology veteran who understands every layer of the stack Charlotte is entering — AND he is the CIO/CISO at ISG, the first company Charlotte will deploy to in production. He has implemented every major ERP on the market. He has built cybersecurity programs from scratch. He has managed global IT operations across continents. He has seen the full arc of enterprise data infrastructure evolution, from Novell to Azure to NetSuite.

As a mentor, he brings the perspective of someone who has lived through every generation of enterprise technology transformation and can tell you exactly what works and what does not at scale. As an advisor, he is the client-side champion who will shepherd Charlotte into ISG's production environment.

### Charlotte Connection

- **He built what Charlotte augments:** Daved implemented ISG's NetSuite ERP, BigCommerce integration, PIM, ITIL processes, NIST security framework. Charlotte does not replace this stack — it makes it observable. Every data flow Daved has built becomes a SIGNAL in Charlotte's substrate.
- **30 years of ERP is 30 years of seeing the limits:** Every ERP implementation is an attempt to make a business observable. Daved has done dozens of them across SAP, Epicor, NetSuite, Syspro, JD Edwards, and more. He knows exactly where they fall short — and that is exactly where Charlotte lives.
- **Security as PROTOCOL:** Every cybersecurity framework Daved has implemented (NIST, ISO 27001, HIPAA) is a PROTOCOL — a behavioral contract that defines expected security posture and measures deviation. Charlotte formalizes this natively.
- **"Big Data" advocate before it was mainstream:** At Cohu, Daved drove "data for sale" and "market share movement" — turning data into revenue. Charlotte's thesis is the same: observable reality creates value.
- **The Feb 24 meeting:** Daved is on the invite list for the ISG Charlotte launch meeting. He is not a spectator — he is the person who will evaluate Charlotte's integration with the stack he built and champion it internally.
