## Background

Evan Mosier is a senior merchandising analyst at Grainger — the largest industrial distribution company in North America ($16B+ revenue, 4.5M+ products). He grew up with Jack Richard in Lake Forest and has spent nearly nine years at Grainger progressing from inside sales associate to government account relationship manager to senior merchandising analyst. That trajectory spans the full commercial stack: selling to individual accounts, managing government institutional relationships, and now analyzing merchandising strategy at the enterprise level.

His path was not linear. He started at Columbia College Chicago studying industrial and product design, then transferred to Mizzou for health sciences with a business minor. He modeled for Ford Models in Chicago. He waited tables. Then he landed at Grainger and stayed — because industrial distribution turned out to be the domain where all his skills converged: product knowledge, relationship management, data analytics (Power BI), and the ability to understand what customers actually need when they walk into a supply chain.

## SumAI Relevance

### Role: Core Team — Touch Pillar

Evan fills the industrial distribution and supply chain analytics gap. Grainger's business is the physical flow of products from manufacturers to the people who use them — every SKU is a NODE, every transaction is a SIGNAL, every warehouse is a spatial substrate, every procurement contract is a PROTOCOL. Evan has been inside this system for nearly nine years.

### Charlotte Connection

- **Grainger IS Charlotte's industrial thesis in practice:** ISG is SomeAI's first client — an industrial service company whose equipment, parts, and supply chain Charlotte will model. Grainger is the distribution layer that feeds companies like ISG. Evan understands the MRO supply chain from the distributor's perspective — product taxonomy, pricing strategy, inventory optimization, government procurement. This is the operational domain knowledge Charlotte needs to model industrial service companies correctly.
- **Merchandising analytics as signal processing:** A Sr Merchandising Analyst at Grainger is analyzing which products sell, to whom, in what combinations, at what margins, across what channels. That is signal analysis on a product graph. Power BI is just the current tool — Charlotte is the upgrade.
- **Government account management:** Three years managing government institutional accounts means Evan understands procurement at the most structured, compliance-heavy level. Government purchasing follows PROTOCOLs more rigidly than any private sector equivalent — RFPs, GSA schedules, compliance requirements. That protocol fluency transfers directly.
- **The product-to-healthcare arc:** Industrial design → health sciences → industrial distribution → healthcare sales → government accounts → merchandising analytics. Every pivot added a new dimension. He understands products (design), patients (health sciences), institutions (government), and data (Power BI/analytics). That is a cross-domain generalist trajectory.
- **Lake Forest + Mizzou double connection:** Grew up with Jack in Lake Forest. Went to Mizzou with Logan McDaniel, Austin Neibarger, and Mason Homoly. Two of the team's strongest geographic clusters intersect in Evan.
