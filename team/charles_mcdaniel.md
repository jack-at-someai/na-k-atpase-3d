## Background

Biochemical engineering, genetics, agricultural technology, data science, and statistics. A cross-disciplinary foundation that bridges the biological and computational — exactly the kind of mind that sees organisms as signal emitters and breeding as optimization.

## Professional History

### SomeAI (Co-Founder)
One of three co-founders alongside Jack Richard and Joseph Richard. Part of the founding team from the earliest days of Charlotte's development.

### Sounder (CEO)
Leading the breeder application deployed by SomeAI. Sounder is the proving ground — 65,000+ breeders, $1.13M tracked sales, partnerships with NSR, CPS, and TSA. The first Charlotte deployment to reach production scale.

### LineLeap
Worked alongside Jack Richard at LineLeap — the venue experience platform that became one of Charlotte's validation domains. Early operational experience in high-throughput service environments.

## SumAI Relevance

Charles sits at the intersection of biology and computation — the same intersection where Charlotte was conceived. His expertise in genetics and biochemical engineering maps directly to the Biomimicry umbrella that covers all five senses. His data science and statistics background is the quantitative spine that makes Charlotte's signal architecture rigorous.

The fact that Charlotte bears his name is not ceremonial. It reflects the depth of his involvement in the foundational thinking that became the infrastructure for observable reality.
