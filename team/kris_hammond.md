## Background

Kris Hammond is the person who kept Jack Richard in the game. When Northwestern wanted all of Jack's attention, when LineLeap wanted all of Jack's attention, when the research wanted all of Jack's attention — and each of them wanted him to quit the other two to focus — Kris was the mentor who helped him juggle all three. That is not a small thing. Without that mentorship, the divergent mind that built Charlotte might have been forced to converge too early.

Hammond's own path mirrors this: a philosophy student at Yale who was going to be a lawyer, got pulled into programming by a friend at a sci-fi club, committed to computer science nine months later, and never looked back. He understands what it means to hold multiple worlds in your head simultaneously.

### Career Trajectory

```
Yale Philosophy → Yale CS (MS, PhD 1986) → University of Chicago CS Lab → Northwestern (1998) →
Narrative Science co-founder (2010) → Salesforce acquisition (2021) → CASMI Director (2022) → AAAI Fellow (2023)

Hammond's father, Philip C. Hammond, was an archaeology professor at the University of Utah who excavated Middle Eastern sites. Kris worked as his father's surveyor during three summer expeditions. The archaeological instinct — digging through layers to find structure — runs in the family.

## Career

### Northwestern University (1998 - Present)

Joined Northwestern in 1998. Named the inaugural **Bill and Cathy Osborn Professor of Computer Science** in 2018. Built and directs the founding **Master of Science in Artificial Intelligence** program. Also directs the **MBAi Program** — the intersection of business and AI.

### Narrative Science (2010 - 2021) — Co-Founder

Co-founded with Larry Birnbaum (also Northwestern). Built AI that converts structured data into natural-language narratives — the company's patented technology, **Quill**, generated news stories, business reports, tweets, and other text content purely from data analysis.

Narrative Science predated Siri (2011), ChatGPT (2022), and Gemini (2023). They were doing natural language generation from data before the world had a name for it.

**Acquired by Salesforce in 2021.** Technology integrated into Tableau, Salesforce's business intelligence and data visualization platform.

### CASMI — Center for Advancing Safety of Machine Intelligence (2022 - Present)

Founded in partnership with **Underwriters Laboratories (UL) Research Institutes' Digital Safety Research Institute**. Mission: establish best practices for evaluating and developing AI that is safe, equitable, and beneficial.

- Won **2024 Chicago Innovation Award**
- Funds research on AI's effects on mental health, children, law, medicine, journalism
- Developed the **AI Incident Database** (open source)
- Consulted the **UN Institute for Disarmament Research** on autonomous lethal weapons

### University of Chicago (Late 1980s)

Built a computer science lab at the University of Chicago after completing his PhD.

## Research & Philosophy

### Core Research Areas

| Domain | Focus |
|--------|-------|
| **Natural Language Generation** | Data → narrative (Quill, Narrative Science) |
| **AI Safety** | CASMI, AI Incident Database, autonomous weapons ethics |
| **Conversational AI** | Elizabeth/Beth avatar system, chatbot interfaces |
| **AI Ethics** | Bias, transparency, hallucination, deepfakes, over-reliance |
| **Computational Creativity** | AI and creative expression |
| **AI + Journalism/Law/Medicine** | Cross-domain AI deployment and consequences |

### Philosophy

Hammond applied his Yale philosophy training — consciousness, knowledge, creativity, logic, the nature of reason — directly to the pursuit of intelligent systems. His position is precise:

> "I'm not a Luddite. I desperately want intelligent systems. But taking away our ability to reason and think — that's horrible for humanity."

> "Systems such as ChatGPT and other AI chatbots aren't looking for the right answer; they are looking for the most likely answer."

AI should be **"partners that make us smarter"** — not replacements for human reasoning. Systems should present multiple viewpoints on complex issues and encourage human thought through interactive engagement.

### Publications

Harvard Business Review, TechCrunch, Recode, Computer World, The International Institute for Analytics. Topics: AI bias, transparency, ethics, chatbot interfaces, human-machine coexistence.

## Personal

Nearly two decades of **improvisational comedy** with the Georgia Pacific improv troupe. The improv instinct — yes-and, building on what's given, holding multiple frames simultaneously — maps directly to his mentorship style and his AI philosophy.

## SumAI Relevance

### Role: Mentor & Advisor — Brain Pillar

Kris Hammond is the academic and entrepreneurial gravity that held Jack Richard's trajectory together during the most critical years. Northwestern + LineLeap + research simultaneously — three full-time commitments that each wanted exclusivity — and Kris was the mentor who said: you can hold all three. That is the divergent mind's most important validation: someone who has done it themselves telling you it is possible.

Hammond co-founded a company that turned data into natural language narratives (Narrative Science → Salesforce). He directs the world's leading AI safety center (CASMI). He is an AAAI Fellow. He teaches the next generation of AI researchers at Northwestern. And he did improv comedy for twenty years. This is someone who understands that intelligence is not one thing — it is the ability to hold multiple frames simultaneously and generate something new from the intersection.

### Charlotte Connection

- **Narrative Science IS Charlotte's thesis:** Narrative Science turned structured data into human-readable stories. Charlotte turns observable reality into structured data. They are two halves of the same pipeline — Charlotte generates the substrate, Narrative Science (now Tableau/Salesforce) generates the narrative. Hammond built the output layer. Jack is building the input layer.
- **CASMI and responsible deployment:** Charlotte's power to observe everything raises exactly the safety and ethics questions CASMI studies. Hammond's AI safety expertise is not adjacent to Charlotte — it is a direct constraint on how Charlotte should be deployed.
- **Philosophy → CS → entrepreneurship → safety:** Hammond's arc from Yale philosophy to AI startup to AI safety center is the exact trajectory Charlotte's deployment model follows: understand the theory, build the product, then ensure it does not cause harm.
- **The mentor who held the divergence together:** Jack's ability to build Charlotte comes from years of juggling startup, research, and school simultaneously. Kris Hammond made that possible by being the mentor who did not demand convergence.
