## Background

Diego is early career. That is not a caveat — it is the point. He represents the next generation of the research lab: a first-generation college student at one of the most competitive design schools in the world, building a freelance practice in branding and visual identity while still completing his BFA. The energy is raw, the perspective is fresh, and the bilingual, first-generation lens brings something to the Sight Pillar that cannot be replicated by hiring senior designers who all come from the same pipeline.

His connection to C.J. Yeh — FIT professor and SumAI team member — creates a mentor-mentee relationship within the pillar itself. This is intentional architecture: the research lab is not just a collection of individuals, it is a network of relationships, and the Yeh-Abad connection ensures that knowledge transfer is happening in real-time within the Sight Pillar.

### Career Trajectory

```
First-generation student --> FIT (Advertising & Digital Design) --> Freelance branding --> SumAI Sight Pillar
```

The path from a first-generation college student to a research lab studying visual perception and brand identity is not the expected trajectory. That is what makes it valuable. Diego did not inherit a design vocabulary from his family — he built one from scratch, which means every assumption that trained designers take for granted is something Diego had to consciously learn and evaluate. That deliberateness produces a different kind of visual thinker.

## Education

| Institution | Degree | Notes |
|-------------|--------|-------|
| Fashion Institute of Technology (FIT) | BFA, Advertising & Digital Design (in progress) | Communication Design department. New York City. |

FIT's Communication Design department is one of the strongest undergraduate design programs in the US. The Advertising & Digital Design concentration combines brand strategy, visual communication, typography, and digital production — the full stack of visual identity work.

## Professional Experience

| Role | Detail |
|------|--------|
| Freelance Designer | Branding, visual identity systems, digital design for clients |
| adidas | Styling — visual merchandising and brand presentation |
| Retail Visual Merchandising | Experience translating brand identity into physical retail environments |

### Freelance Design Practice

Diego's freelance work in branding and visual identity is the proving ground. Every brand identity project is an exercise in the same problem Charlotte solves: how do you take a complex entity (a company, a product, a person) and create a coherent visual representation that communicates its essential identity across every touchpoint? The brand system is the visual PROTOCOL — a behavioral contract that defines how the entity presents itself to the world.

### adidas Styling & Retail Visual Merchandising

Experience at adidas in styling and visual merchandising means Diego has worked at the intersection of brand identity and physical space. Visual merchandising is the translation of brand identity into three-dimensional environments — how products are arranged, how light is used, how the customer's eye is guided through a retail space. This is Sight Pillar research in its most commercially applied form.

## The FIT Connection — C.J. Yeh

Diego's connection to C.J. Yeh creates a structured mentor-mentee pipeline within the Sight Pillar:

| Person | Role | Pillar Position |
|--------|------|-----------------|
| C.J. Yeh | FIT Professor, Communication Design | Sight Pillar — senior, academic anchor |
| Diego Abad | FIT Student, Advertising & Digital Design | Sight Pillar — emerging generation |

The Yeh-Abad relationship mirrors the Calzada father-son bridge (Norberto and Diego Calzada) and the Homoly father-son bridge (Andrew and Mason Homoly) — structured generational connections within the research lab that ensure knowledge does not stay siloed in a single generation or career stage.

C.J. Yeh brings decades of academic design research and pedagogical authority. Diego brings the energy, the fresh eye, and the bilingual cultural perspective. The Sight Pillar needs both.

## SumAI Relevance

### Pillar: Sight (primary)

The Sight Pillar studies visual perception, visual communication, and the design of visual systems that make complex information observable. Diego's role anchors the pillar in applied visual identity — the commercial discipline of creating brand systems, visual languages, and design systems that communicate identity across media.

### Charlotte Connection

- **Every visual identity is a SIGNAL:** A brand's visual system — logo, color palette, typography, imagery style — is a set of SIGNALs that the brand emits across every touchpoint. Charlotte's SIGNAL primitive captures the same concept: an observable emission from an identity over time. Diego's work in branding is the creation and management of these visual signals.
- **Brand systems are PROTOCOLs:** A brand style guide is a behavioral contract. It defines how the brand will present itself in every context — what colors to use, what typefaces to deploy, what tone of voice to maintain. This is a PROTOCOL: expected behavior, defined in advance, with deviation detectable. Diego builds these PROTOCOLs for clients.
- **Bilingual perspective as cross-cultural sensing:** Diego's bilingual (English/Spanish) background means he processes visual communication through two cultural lenses. Visual identity does not translate uniformly across cultures — color associations, typographic conventions, spatial organization all shift. This dual perspective is a research asset for a Sight Pillar that aims to study visual perception universally, not just within English-speaking Western design conventions.
- **First-generation lens:** A first-generation college student does not inherit assumptions about "how design works" — every principle is learned consciously. This produces a designer who can articulate why a design decision works, not just that it works. That analytical capacity is what separates a research lab member from a production designer.
- **Next generation:** Diego is early career by design. The research lab is building for decades, not quarters. Investing in emerging talent alongside senior practitioners ensures the lab's knowledge compounds across generations — the same thesis that Charlotte's temporal substrate encodes.
