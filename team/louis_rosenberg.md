## Background

Louis Rosenberg invented augmented reality. In 1992, working at the Air Force Research Laboratory and Stanford's Center for Design Research, he built the Virtual Fixtures platform — the first functional mixed reality system, enabling people to reach out and interact with real and virtual objects as a unified perceptual reality. He was 23. Studies showed the system could significantly boost human performance in dexterous physical tasks. That was 34 years ago.

Since then, Rosenberg has founded four companies, taken one public on NASDAQ (Immersion Corporation, 1999 — the first VR company to go public, still trading 30 years later), had another acquired by Google (Outland Research, 2011), held a tenured endowed professorship at Cal Poly, worked at NASA Ames in the VR lab, published over 100 peer-reviewed papers, been awarded over 300 patents, and written multiple books about AI risk including the Amazon bestseller *Our Next Reality* (Hachette, 2024).

But the work that matters most to Charlotte is what happened after 2014. Rosenberg founded Unanimous AI to pursue Collective Superintelligence — amplifying the intelligence of networked human groups using AI algorithms modeled on biological swarm behavior. Instead of replacing human intelligence with artificial intelligence, Unanimous AI makes groups of humans smarter together than any individual could be alone. The technology has been deployed by Fortune 500 companies, the United Nations, and the US Air Force.

Jack Richard spent two years researching for Rosenberg and Unanimous AI at Northwestern — summers and during the school year. When Jack left Northwestern to co-found LineLeap with Logan McDaniel, he continued the research privately, for free, because the questions were too important to stop asking. This is where Jack and Logan went deep into sports prediction, human-applied AI, and the deeper layers of group intelligence — conviction, entrenchment, resonance. Logan, who would not have had access to this kind of research otherwise, got to participate because of his relationship with Jack. The two of them had been living together since college, left Florida together to take the leap of faith on LineLeap, and have been pushing this needle together for a decade.

## SumAI Relevance

### Role: Influence — Brain Pillar

Louis Rosenberg's influence on Charlotte runs deeper than a lecture hall. Jack Richard spent two years doing research with Rosenberg's Unanimous AI group at Northwestern, continued privately during LineLeap, and brought Logan McDaniel into the work. This is where Charlotte's understanding of group intelligence was formed — not just observing individuals, but understanding how groups converge on decisions, how conviction forms and dissolves, how entrenchment resists new information, and how resonance amplifies signal across a network of minds.

### Charlotte Connection

- **Swarm intelligence IS Charlotte's group observation model:** Unanimous AI amplifies group intelligence by modeling how biological swarms — bees, fish, birds — make collective decisions without central control. Charlotte observes groups of NODEs emitting SIGNALs and detects emergent patterns. The underlying principle is the same: intelligence emerges from the interactions between agents, not from any single agent.
- **Conviction, entrenchment, and resonance:** Jack and Logan's research with Rosenberg's group went into the deeper layers of human collective intelligence — how strongly individuals hold beliefs (conviction), how resistant those beliefs are to change (entrenchment), and how ideas amplify across a group (resonance). These are not standard AI metrics. They are the psychological substrate beneath Charlotte's SIGNAL architecture — the reason two signals with the same numerical value can have completely different implications depending on the conviction and entrenchment of the emitter.
- **The Jack-Logan research partnership:** Rosenberg's work created the conditions for Jack and Logan's deepest intellectual collaboration. They had lived together since college. They left Florida together for LineLeap. But it was the Unanimous AI research that took them beyond application development into fundamental questions about intelligence — what it means for a group to be smarter than its members, and how AI can amplify rather than replace human cognition. This is the intellectual origin of the SumAI / SomeAI duality: SumAI as the divergent research engine studying intelligence, SomeAI as the convergent deployment engine applying it.
- **The Penn and Teller dynamic:** Jack describes himself and Logan as Penn and Teller — Jack with lots of words, less meaning; Logan with less words, more meaning. That complementarity was forged in the research they did together under Rosenberg's influence. The swarm intelligence framework gave them a language for what they already were: two agents with different signal profiles whose collective output exceeded either individual's.
- **AR/VR/Haptics as sensory engineering:** Before swarm intelligence, Rosenberg spent two decades building the hardware that extends human senses — virtual reality (Sight), augmented reality (Sight overlay), haptics (Touch). He literally invented the field of mixed reality. Charlotte's five-sense pillar structure (Sight, Touch, Taste, Sound, Smell + Brain) maps onto Rosenberg's career: he started by engineering individual senses, then moved to engineering the collective intelligence that emerges when sensory agents interact.
- **Northwestern's AI ecosystem:** Rosenberg's connection to Jack through Northwestern adds another thread to the university's influence on Charlotte: Ken Forbus (qualitative reasoning), Kris Hammond (narrative AI, Jack's mentor), Dave Ferrucci (explicable AI), and Louis Rosenberg (collective intelligence). Four distinct approaches to the same problem — making intelligence observable, explicable, and amplifiable — all converging in one student's thesis.
